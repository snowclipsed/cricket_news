2.3,"Boult to Dhawan, , a flat deck and Dhawan is relishing even on good balls. A short of a length delivery outside off, Dhawan hangs back and punches it to thread the ball between cover point and point for a four. Boult unable to find any movement off the deck or in the air",1680703924852
3.1," KM Asif to Prabhsimran, , that's slapped! Dances down, KM Asif digs it in but he gets the freedom to slap it over mid-off. Punjab mean business ",1680704112512
3.3," KM Asif to Prabhsimran, , wow! That was a very good ball. Banged in, cramped for room. Prabhsimran hopped up and just steered the ball close to his body to get it past point and third man for a four ",1680704187600
3.4," KM Asif to Prabhsimran, , you don't want to be soothsayer while watching this game! He was waiting for this short ball and then just dismissed it over deep square for a sixer. Massive hit indeed. Got hold of the delivery and sent it well over the fence ",1680704236570

5.6," Holder to Prabhsimran, 1 run, tipped over the bar! A goalkeeper would have been proud of it but not Padikkal. That was a widish length ball and Prabhsimran ended up slicing the hit. The ball swirled in the air and Padikkal in a way overran it and lost balance when he was trying to clutch that one out of thin air. The ball hit his hands and went away ",1680704987117

8.1," Boult to Prabhsimran, , wow! Flat-batted over the bowler's head for a sixer. A short ball, sits up and Prabhsimran smashes it down the ground. Again a stable base, doesn't hurry into the shot and infuses enough power into the shot to get enough distance on the shot ",1680705722297
9.4," Holder to Prabhsimran,  Caught by Buttler!! Buttler plucks out a terrific catch! It had to be an excellent piece of effort to bring an end to this wonderful innings. That was a short ball, Prabhsimran looked to slap it but ended up slicing it. The ball went aerial and the man from long-off ran in, covered some good ground and then dived to get two hands to it.

10.1," Ashwin to Dhawan, no run, that was slapped back hard! Was a fuller ball, outside off, Dhawan stayed low to smash it back at his partner at the other end who just couldn't get out of the way.

11.6," Chahal to Dhawan, , for a second it looked as if he was beaten in flight. Chahal pushed it outside off and Dhawan jumped down a little too soon it seemed. But he managed to drag it powerfully and over long-on. Good muscular hit from the southpaw and that should give him some confidence to get going. ",1680707111734
12.5," KM Asif to Dhawan, , excellent from Dhawan! Waited on the length ball after walking across his sticks and then helped it over the short fine fielder for a four ",1680707405567

13.4,"Chahal to Dhawan, , back-to-back boundaries for Dhawan, very full and on the leg-stump line, Dhawan clears his front-leg and whips it wide of mid-wicket, , he's pressing on after a slow start, ",1680707726375
13.6," Chahal to Dhawan, ,  - Dhawan is in the mood now, flighted delivery on off, he stays leg-sided and then goes inside out over cover for a boundary, another expensive over from Chahal,  ",1680707843224

15.2," Chahal to Dhawan, , he nails the reverse sweep now, backward point is in and this is a tempting option - gets down low and gets enough on the shot to clear the infield, couple of bounces and over the ropes ",1680708319128
15.4," Chahal to Jitesh Sharma,  Caught by Riyan Parag!! Jitesh has found Parag to perfection at long-off, and the home crowd is thrilled to bits. Was a low full-toss as Jitesh jumped down the pitch, was looking to go inside out, but he couldn't completely under it, it meant that he couldn't get the necessary elevation on the shot, went straighter and down the throat of long-off, who moved across swiftly to his left.  ",1680708457126
16.1," Ashwin to Raza,  Bowled!! Lovely, lovely stuff from Ashwin and the Royals have two in no time - was the carrom ball, drifted in with the angle and then went away with the angle, drew Raza forward and then straightened past the outside edge, crashing into the off-stump. Ashwin certainly enjoyed that and it's a no show from Raza tonight at the Barsapara.  ",1680708891104
17.3," Holder to Shahrukh Khan, 1 run, has Shahrukh been run-out at the bowler's end? He was trying to scramble home after driving straight to the fielder at cover. Hetmyer's throw is slightly wide and that gives him enough time to slide the bat in - NOT OUT is the call. Was a low full-toss from Holder ",1680709318540
17.5," Holder to Dhawan, , , he gets one reverse lap away, the timing is sweet and it sails over the ropes for a maximum - Holder saw it coming and bowled full and at the pads, somehow Dhawan got his bat down in time and scooped it over backward point ",1680709383226
18.1,"KM Asif to Dhawan, , Asif goes full and wide of off as Dhawan pre-empted the shuffle across the off-stump, looks to drive and misses, isn't called as a wide and  - it did go past the tramlines, but Dhawan was a long way across as well. It actually didn't land on the pitch, the ball was close to the bat, but UltraEdge has a flat line. Not sure this can be given as a wide, it has just gone past the bat, but it hasn't landed at all, and so will be called as a wide. Good spot by Shahrukh Khan who asked his partner to review",1680709678208

19.4," Holder to Shahrukh Khan,  Caught by Buttler!! Holder has his second and it's yet another smart catch from Buttler, running in from long-on - was very full and angling across the right-hander, Shahrukh didn't have the room to get under it, scooped it in the air and towards long-on, the ball seemed to be dropping safely, but Buttler ran in, slid forward and then took a good two-handed catch, right in front of his boot lace.  ",1680710216826
0.1," Sam Curran to Jaiswal, , .. and Jaiswal is off and running in some style, fraction short by Curran and he's quick to swivel across, picked the length early and shovelled it into the stands over square leg, that's some start from the youngster ",1680711432240
1.1," Arshdeep Singh to Jaiswal, , , short of a good length and just outside off, was an off-pace delivery, but with width on offer, Jaiswal could wait on it and crash it square past point for a boundary ",1680711772850
1.3," Arshdeep Singh to Jaiswal,  Caught by (sub)Short!! Catching practice at extra-cover, on a good length and well wide of off, Jaiswal leant into the drive, was slightly early into the shot and ended it hitting it straight into the hands of Short at extra-cover - the substitute fielder's first impact on #IPL2023 and the in-form Jaiswal has been dismissed.  ",1680712020590
2.2," Sam Curran to Buttler, 2 runs, a chance and , the ball is following him, but he'd reckon he should have taken it, did all the hard work, got across to the ball at a good height, but as he fell down, the ball popped out of his grasp, short of a good length and angling across the right-hander - Buttler was in no control over the pull and the ball lobbed over square leg, big big chance that's missed by the Kings ",1680712331589
2.3," Sam Curran to Buttler, , , way too short from Curran, no real pace and Buttler can hammer the pull over mid-wicket, couple of bounces and over the ropes ",1680712376879
3.2," Arshdeep Singh to Ashwin,  Caught by Dhawan!! A duck for Ashwin and the experiment has ended in failure - hard length causing his downfall, banged in short and it kept riding onto the right-hander, cramped for room on the pull, all that Ashwin could manage was a big top-edge, lobbed high and over mid-on. Dhawan kept back-pedalling, got into a good position and held on, before starting his thigh-slap celebrations. RR have lost their opener and now their make-shift opener as well.  ",1680712607888
3.4," Arshdeep Singh to Samson, , , length ball and right in the slot, right in the slot for a free-flowing lofted drive by Samson - he hits through the line and sends it sailing over the straight boundary for a maximum ",1680712780469

5.4," Nathan Ellis to Buttler,  Caught&Bowled!! Ellis has got the big wicket and he's chuffed to bits, so good from the Australian bowler - very full and at the stumps, Buttler was looking to play the on-drive, the bat turned slightly on impact and the ball popped up off the pad, Ellis was quick on the followthrough, runs forward, dives and completes a good two-handed catch, pivotal moment of the match.  ",1680713351334
5.6,"Nathan Ellis to Padikkal, no run, short of a good length and angling down leg, Padikkal was looking to flick and missed, must've brushed the thigh-pad as it's not called as a wide, but Padikkal is unimpressed and . Need UltraEdge to confirm and it has indeed flicked the trousers on its way to the keeper. So, ",1680713567984
7.3," Rahul Chahar to Samson, , the outfield is lightning quick. Samson waited for this short ball, cut it from around fourth stump and beat the diving right hand of the fielder at backward point ",1680713926635
10.6," Nathan Ellis to Samson,  Caught by (sub)Short!! Nathan Ellis at it again. He's picked up RR's two best batters in his 2 overs. The boundaries dried up and Samson had to take a risk.

11.5," Rahul Chahar to Riyan Parag, , leave it to me, says the hometown boy! Rahul Chahar drops it short on the stumps, Riyan Parag swivels deep inside the crease and sends it for a  into the mid-wicket orbit ",1680715182107
12.3," Raza to Padikkal, , finally! Some slice of luck for Devdutt Padikkal. He's been struggling to time the ball and this should give him a bit of momentum. Throws the kitchen sink at a full and wide delivery, slices it off the top-edge and gets it flying over the fielder at short third to his left ",1680715443478
12.6," Raza to Riyan Parag, , shouts of ""catch it"" but the fielder at long-on will remain as a spectator. Raza fed the length Riyan Parag was looking for - fullish and right in the swinging zone, it's been pumped over the long-on with disdain ",1680715531927
13.4," Arshdeep Singh to Riyan Parag, , this short ball gets big on Riyan Parag but he manages to slam the pull behind square on the leg-side, the fielder at deep square runs across to his right but ball wins the race ",1680715780249
14.1," Nathan Ellis to Riyan Parag,  Caught by Shahrukh Khan!! Nathan Ellis - the Hobart Hurricanes boy is bringing in all his BBL and national experience into play. It's his  Unveils his most trusted delivery - the cross-seamer on a fuller length and lures Riyan Parag into a big hit.

14.6," Nathan Ellis to Padikkal,  Bowled!! Nathan Ellis - you absolute rockstar! Who said this is a batting track says Ellis. He is just making the batters look silly with superb mix of variations. You could almost tell from Padikkal's reaction that he is slightly relieved than disappointed after a really harrowing 26-ball 21 that included one lucky boundary (off the top-edge). Ellis unleashes the cross-seam length delivery and bowls it high pace, it kisses the deck and bounces a tad extra to hit the top of middle and off  ",1680716275908
16.1," Nathan Ellis to Hetmyer, , that must have landed at the Kensington Oval in Barbados! Half-volley around middle and leg and Hetmyer's dispatched that for a mighty maximum over mid-wicket ",1680716727541
16.5," Nathan Ellis to Dhruv Jurel, , have some of that says Dhruv Jurel. This boy's got some skill. A dipping full toss around middle and leg, Jurel crouches and manages to get under it before lapping it neatly over fine leg ",1680716929865

17.3," Sam Curran to Hetmyer, , stands tall and spanks the length delivery in the gap between mid-off and extra cover. Brute power from Shimron Hetmyer ",1680717236232
17.6," Sam Curran to Hetmyer, , Raza....Raza....and it goes over him. Hetmyer pulls and, for a fleeting moment, it seemed to be landing down the throat of deep mid-wicket. The ball though kept sailing flat and over the leaping effort of the fielder for a  ",1680717417440
18.2," Arshdeep Singh to Dhruv Jurel, , one bounce and over the ropes! Arshdeep Singh overcooks the yorker and ends up bowling it a tad too full outside off, Jurel maintains a solid base and pumps it over mid-off with terrific timing ",1680717599000
18.3," Arshdeep Singh to Dhruv Jurel, , Dhruv Jurel has been an impact player since his U 19 days, so I'm sure the tag of Impact player today wouldn't have bothered him one bit. He pumps his chest after smoking one of the best shots of the night. It got Ian Bishop going ""ttteeerrrriiiiffffficccc"". I0$ It's a slot ball outside off, Dhruv Jurel stays leg-side of the delivery and carves it up and over extra cover for a maximum ",1680717655626
18.4," Arshdeep Singh to Dhruv Jurel, , is that ABD? My word. The sheer confidence this lad's got.... He second-guessed the yorker and shuffled across off-stump while crouching low, gets under the full delivery and scoops it with superb timing to the right of a diving fine leg fielder. Harpreet tried his best, but couldn't quite pull it off ",1680717780800
18.6," Arshdeep Singh to Hetmyer, 2 runs,  High full toss and Hetmyer has mistimes the slog into the leg-side, the fielder from deep mid-wicket comes running in to his right and shells it down despite a well-timed slide. Hetmyer isn't happy, but he's managed to pinch a couple of runs... ",1680717923342
19.2," Sam Curran to Hetmyer, 2 runs, low full toss wide of off, Hetmyer slices the drive to the right of sweeper cover. A direct hit at the batting end would have been interesting, wasn't to be... ",1680718106271
19.3," Sam Curran to Hetmyer,  Hetmyer Run Out!! 1 run completed. Hetmyer smashes the full toss to long-off and looks for a non-existent second. SRK was quick to get to the ball and he sends in a sharp throw at the bowling end, Hetmyer wasn't even in the frame. He just took off and stopped midway. While walking back to the dug-out, Hetmyer gives a thumbs up to Dhruv Jurel, suggesting him to continue the good work...  ",1680718215627
19.6," Sam Curran to Dhruv Jurel, , half-volley on the pads and it's been helped away past short fine to his right. Sam Curran isn't bothered one bit, he calmly walks up to the umpire to collect his towel and cap.  ",1680718444436
