preview,Both RR and Punjab are coming into this game on the back of convincing wins. The narratives don't spark much of an excitement though. It is the title drought for both units that would be pushing them to do better than before. RR won in 2008 and made it to the finale in 2022 only to be outdone by the Gujarat unit. Punjab have had hapless and reckless years ever since the inception of the IPL. They came close in 2014 but post that the same story has been told on a loop.,1680698692242,66208
preview,I0$ informs -- Greetings from Guwahati. It rained from midnight till about 4:00 in the morning. But the weather looks fine now.,1680698941593,66208
preview,I0$ Their top 3. The artillery at the top fired the opponents down. Almost sealed the fate in the first half. Their bowlers also chipped in to make it an all-round effort. Seems this is an extension of 2022!,1680699037230,66208
preview,"I0$ Their top order also batted impressively. Arshdeep's new ball exploits also sowed the seeds of the win against KKR. D/L came into play and bridged the gap. Barring Russell's threatening cameo, Punjab didn't come under much pressure.",1680699176902,66208
preview,"Gokul adds, ""Lots of pink in the stands and some PBKS jerseys, as expected. But the CSK yellow and jerseys with No.7 on the back also seen at the Barsapara stadium.""",1680699241916,66208
preview, The dimensions of the ground are unique. The square boundaries vary from one another. The pitch looks a belter. Little live grass and there is some dryness on the wicket. Players who can swing the ball like Boult can be effective.,1680699367937,66208
preview,What both should guard against? RR can be found culprit of an overdependence on their top-order. And Punjab have a definite amount of reliance on Arshdeep. Sam Curran unlike the last game has to do a better job with the new and old ball.,1680700014447,66208
preview,The venue is the Barsapara Stadium. It is expected to rain runs. Expect a run feast. In that case the experience in the bowling line up of RR will definitely come in handy.,1680700293467,66208
preview, Tremendous start. It is a group which is pretty familiar with each other. I suppose we have continued with the form from the last year. We appreciate it is a new year and a new season. New personnel. New faces. But the messages and the consistency around the change room has been the same. We look to back each other. My role is to pick uo early wickets with the new ball.,1680700496974,66208
preview," I have been given more responsibility, I used to bat at 6 in the domestics, where I was mainly used as a finisher. But here we have players like Sam Curran and Raza, that's the reason I have been pushed up, it's a chance to play more sensibly and contribute to the team. My role changed with the game. In the last game I needed to carry forward the momentum created by Bhanuka (Rajapaksha). My role was to score at a good rate which I did and made some 25 odd runs in quick time. My first time over here, I watched the India-South Africa game, it was a high-scoring game. So I think the crowd here in Guwahati will enjoy watching the match.",1680701228680,66208

The players have gotten used to the conditions. We are going in with the same side. Very happy to see them grow. Jaiswal and Parag have grown a lot learning from the experienced guys.,1680701438778,66208
preview, We all know the dew comes. We also wanted to bowl first. It is alright. We are used to it. Let's go day by day. Not putting too much on pressure on myself. The process matters the most.

18.3," Arshdeep Singh to Dhruv Jurel, , Dhruv Jurel has been an impact player since his U 19 days, so I'm sure the tag of Impact player today wouldn't have bothered him one bit.

post," Phewf! What a game. It was very clear from the onset that anything under 200 would be really tough to defend, and it did get really tight towards the end. Yes, there was that Dhruv Jurel magic, but the Royals never really looked out of the contest. There could be questions about Ashwin's promotion and the non-boundary overs from 8-11, and of course the struggles of Padikkal. Despite all of that, they threatened to steal the game thanks to a 22 year-old superstar Dhruv Jurel. The impact player not only proved his worth in his first-ever outing of the IPL, but displayed his range and fierce attitude during his 15-ball 32. All said and done, Nathan Ellis deserves a huge chunk of credit for Punjab's victory. He bowled at crucial stages of the game and picked up important wickets to draw the game in his side's favour. On a day which saw the bowlers travel frequently, Ellis picked up 4 and just conceded 30 off his 4 overs. Bonzer!! Post-match reactions imminent, stick around...",1680718619417,66208

post," - To be honest, it was a very good track to bat on, not much movement with the new ball and they batted really well, had the momentum in the powerplay. Our bowlers used the variations on a high-scoring wicket and I thought we did well to restrict them to 197. Jos wasn't fully fit (injured his finger while taking the catch), the thinking behind keeping Padikkal (in the middle order) was to tackle their two spinners in the middle overs. The coaches have put a lot of work behind him (on Dhruv Jurel), we had a work week camp before the IPL, but the way they have worked a lot of time in our academies (during off-season), having faced 1000s of balls and I'm happy with the way they're progressing. I was expecting the dew to come in the second innings, but it was evident that it was there right at the start, need to be prepared better for such things in the next game.",1680718619428,66208

All that matters is we won. Amazingly hard to bowl with the wet ball. It is incredibly hard to hold the seam. It is naturally hard to bowl a yorker with a cross seam.",1680718619438,66208
