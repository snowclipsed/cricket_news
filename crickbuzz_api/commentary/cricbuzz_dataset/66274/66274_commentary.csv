Yes, they won the last game with only one ball to spare but they were in total control of the proceedings. If not for that once-in-a-lifetime innings from Rinku Singh, the defending champions would have had a 100% win record this season. Hardik and Co. won't be tinkering with their successful combination. ",1681649293204,66274
preview," too don't have too many chinks in their armour. Unlike GT, all of RR's win have come while batting first with Jos Buttler and Yashasvi Jaiswal doing the bulk of the scoring. Hetmyer too has been striking the ball really well lower down the order. In the bowling department, their three experienced bowlers - Boult, Ashwin and Chahal - have been amongst the wickets. Sandeep Sharma's confidence should be sky-high too after defending I0$ against MSD and Jadeja. The Royals have the best NRR (+1.588), courtesy two big wins.

post," When you play quality opponents on a quality wicket, you get such games. Very happy to compete in such a game and come out on top. It was important to rotate our bowlers, they were playing some quality cricket and we had to respect that. The whole team came up well today and we could restrict them to around 170. The start we had, it shows how good a wicket this was. The new ball the quality of swing bowling was good and we had to respect that. But today Zampa coming was a way to match-up with the opponents. He was the match-up for Miller and almost got the wicket, but the catch was dropped. (On Hetmyer) He doesn't like easy situations, we like putting him in such situations because he usually wins us games from such situations.",1681667543901,66274

post,"I don't have any words. Difficult to win against these guys, they beat us thrice last year but today was sort of a revenge. I practise these situations, it helps when you practise with that mindset of knowing we are few wickets down and chasing 100 with 8 overs to go. (On Noor Ahmad bowling the final over) I was actually pretty happy to be honest, he bowled well throughout so the first ball all I was thinking about was getting that double and take it from there.",1681668114940,66274

post,"The final of 2022 was a pretty drub affair, but this game today more than compensates for it. Cricket of the highest quality played between two opponents who matched each other stride for stride. Ultimately, Rajasthan got over the line... It was a pleasure covering this game for y'all.
