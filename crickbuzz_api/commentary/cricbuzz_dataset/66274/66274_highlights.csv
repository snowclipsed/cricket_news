0.3,"Boult to Saha,  Caught&Bowled!! Boult strikes early, again! Length delivery, swinging in on middle and leg, Saha is early to close his bat-face and gets a fat leading edge that goes a mile up in the air. Three fielders - point, keeper and mid-wicket - converge and all three go for the catch despite the keeper calling for it. There's a collision as well between the two. Samson fails to gather it because of that. But fortunately for him, the ball pops up and goes into the hands of Boult who was only watching and hoping for someone else to drop. Dramatic! ",1681653773619

Oh wait, there's a run-out appeal. Samson is confident. And Sai Sudharsan is short. The ball was dribbling towards mid-on and Sudharsan was initially looking to get back into the crease at the bowler's end. Gill kept running and Sudharsan was late to take off for the single.

14.3," Chahal to Miller, , Miller shimmies down the wicket and spanks this towards long-on. Buttler in the deep sprints to his right, puts in a dive, but this ball was struck so hard, there was no chance to get there ",1681657585113

15.2,"Alzarri Joseph to Hetmyer, , Oh dear. This one slips out Joseph's hand. A waist high full toss and Hetmyer was just getting his bat down to protect himself. The ball takes a leading edge at flies over third-man for a six. Given no ball by the umpire but challenged by Pandya, replays show Hetmyer was out his crease and the ball would have just ended below waist. Strangely, Shami was standing well in front of the boundary rope. He didn't even jump and the ball just cleared the ropes...",1681665376794

19.2," Noor Ahmad to Hetmyer, , He's done it!! Take a bow Shimron Hetmyer, punches the air and yelps in delight. Too short by Noor Ahmad, allows Hetmyer to go back and slam his pull over cow corner.
