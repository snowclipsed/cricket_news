preview," ""It was a shocker of a wicket"", that's how Hardik Pandya had summarized the state of the wicket after India had a narrow win at the Ekana stadium in January against the visiting New Zealand side. The Ekana stadium is where the game will be played tonight. But the last game against Delhi saw plenty of runs being scored. LSG thumped DC to start proceedings in IPL 2023. But they were humbled by CSK a few days later. SRH on the other hand were handed a shellacking by RR in their opening encounter. Contrasting starts for both units but they would want two points from tonight's game, that's the common agenda for sure for both the teams.",1680871604128,66215
preview,I0$ Kyle Mayers with the bat and Mark Wood with the ball have been superb but haven't had much support from the others.,1680871744880,66215
preview,I0$ Nothing worked for them in their game against RR. Natarajan's bowling looked good though.,1680871757396,66215
preview,KL Rahul and the middle-order is due for runs. The bowling attack got some pounding against CSK but they would want to bounce back.,1680872186709,66215
preview, Almost everything. SRH need to shrug off the rust that was seen against RR. The senior cricketers have to take the mantle on themselves to deliver the goods.,1680872206590,66215
preview,We can't read too much into the head-to-head battles as well as they have squared off against each other only once. LSG won that encounter last year by 10 runs. The last two seasons have been poor for SRH and so much so that they had finished last in 2021 and ended up being 8th out of 10 teams in 2022. But they would want to bounce back and would want to do it soon. LSG were in the play-offs last season.,1680872314827,66215
preview," It has been great to come back. The guys are ready to get going. I have got a role tonight. I can't tell you what it is. I have played a handful of games here. Every time I have played here, it has been a little different. I think it is about assessing the conditions as qucikly as you can and executing your plans. I don't really practice that much when I am in form. Just hit a couple of balls and take some catches.",1680872623339,66215
preview, I am happy that I have given the responsibility of leading the spinners. I am trying to keep them quiet. I am trying to put the balls in the right areas. I am trying nothing different. You get wickets some days and some days you don't.,1680872831308,66215
preview," When you move to black soil, there is less pace and bounce. There are less blades of grass on this. There shouldn't be any dew as well. All the teams have wanted to chase in the IPL so far. There should be less spin compared to red soil wicket.",1680872941830,66215
preview,,1680874246102,66215
preview, We will look to bat first. The wicket looks dry. Ideally we will get to our first win. The guys are looking excited. There are two changes. One of them is me.,1680874246112,66215
preview, Too early to say anything. We ended up batting well in the last game. We will look to adjust and play well tonight. We can come in with a set plan as we are playing for the first time here. Wood has the flu and will miss out. Avesh is taking a break as he got himself injured. We will look to be aggressive and get the wickets.,1680874246122,66215

0.1," Mayers to Anmolpreet Singh, 1 run, little bit of movement and the ball keeps low for the batter to turn the ball down behind square for a single. Angled in from over the wicket as the bowler went wide of the crease ",1680876051609,66215
0.2," Mayers to Mayank, 1 run, stabs a length delivery into the off-side and they get a single. That was outside off and Mayank patted it down past the fielder to steal a single ",1680876091087,66215
0.3," Mayers to Anmolpreet Singh, 1 run, length delivery, angles in, the batter looks to tuck it and misses I guess. Got an inside edge and they hared through for a single ",1680876133611,66215
0.4," Mayers to Mayank, 1 run, keeps low, angles in, Mayank manages to tuck that down to deep mid for a single ",1680876156160,66215
0.5," Mayers to Anmolpreet Singh, no run, gets the ball to angle in from a length and the batter gets his bat down to pat it away to mid-on ",1680876189437,66215
0.6," Mayers to Anmolpreet Singh, 1 run, angles it in from a length and Anmolpreet Singh tucks it wide of long-on for a single. That wasn't a pacy delivery and Anmolpreet Singh had enough time to play it off the back foot ",1680876229778,66215
0.6, SRH have kept all options open with their impact sub by going with only three overseas in the original XI. This is quite a smart use of the rule!,1680876229779,66215
0.6,,1680876316032,66215
1.1," Unadkat to Anmolpreet Singh, no run, angles across a fuller length delivery and Anmolpreet Singh drives it but finds the man at cover. That was not timed nor placed by Anmolpreet Singh ",1680876323600,66215
1.2," Unadkat to Anmolpreet Singh, 2 runs, whips the ball away off the pads but the slowness of the track doesn't allow him to get it away. The ball lands short of the man at deep backward. They get a brace. The wicket is pretty slow and can't see it quickening up as well ",1680876359057,66215
1.3," Unadkat to Anmolpreet Singh, no run, length delivery, Anmolpreet Singh stabs the pull down and finds the man at mid-wicket. Again no sense on timing on it ",1680876393991,66215
1.4," Unadkat to Anmolpreet Singh, 1 run, bottom-hands the drive off the cue-end of the bat and dives into his crease to make it as the throw came in from the man at mid-off. Was a fuller ball, angled across, Anmolpreet Singh got a stride out and looked to punch it but struggled for timing on it ",1680876442875,66215
1.5," Unadkat to Mayank, 1 run, and the fumble by the man at mid-off allows a safe single. Was a length delivery, Mayank stabbed it to mid-off and set off. The fielder was culprit of watching the batter I suppose and took his eyes off at the last second to fumble it ",1680876496284,66215

1.6," Unadkat to Anmolpreet Singh, , and that has travelled alright! Was banged in short, Anmolpreet Singh swivelled on the back foot to pull it. Got a bit of a top-edge I reckon but that flew well over the fine leg fence. Travelled really high and far ",1680876545299,66215
1.6,,1680876619984,66215
2.1," Krunal Pandya to Mayank, no run, flatter one from the tweaker and at the sticks, patted back to the bowler. KL is quick to realize that the deck is slow ",1680876622671,66215
2.2," Krunal Pandya to Mayank, , sits down and gets it over the man at 45 degrees for a four. Was down on to his pads, he kneeled down and managed to get under the ball to lift it over the infield ",1680876645857,66215
2.3," Krunal Pandya to Mayank, 1 run, tucks the ball away on to the on-side for a single ",1680876679409,66215
2.4," Krunal Pandya to Anmolpreet Singh, 1 run, keeps it at the sticks, inside-halves the ball away on to the on-side for a single ",1680876704509,66215
2.4," Krunal Pandya to Mayank,  Caught!! ",1680876741349,66215
2.5," Krunal Pandya to Mayank,  Caught by Stoinis!! A soft dismissal. Not the first one you will see tonight. Got a big stride forward, looked to drive it aerially but failed to get it over the man at cover. Just a friendly chip and the man at cover leapt a little to take it. Easy take to send back Mayank. Was a tossed up delivery, outside off, the ball held on to the surface a little and Mayank was a little early into the shot.  ",1680876744943,66215
2.5,,1680876832873,66215
2.6," Krunal Pandya to Tripathi, no run, quicker one, angles in, keeps low, Tripathi bends down quickly and manages to cue-end it. The keeper appeals as he feels it went off the bat, then the batter's boot and was taken by the slip fielder. But I guess he realized it went to ground and not on to the boot ",1680876840440,66215
3.1," Unadkat to Anmolpreet Singh, no run, tch tch! Sorry state of affairs as far as the wicket is concerned. That snails and snakes to the keeper as the batter is undone on the pull. Was a slower delivery and kept very low to outdo the batter ",1680876936891,66215
3.2," Unadkat to Anmolpreet Singh, 1 run, pats the ball down to mid-off and scampers off for a single. The wicket here will again make some headlines... ",1680876940375,66215

3.4, Mayank's poor run in IPL from last year continues.....,1680877027074,66215
3.5," Unadkat to Tripathi, 1 run, pat and run to another slower delivery angled across. The batter hit it and set off. Anmolpreet Singh was a little late to react. Sadly,  ",1680877067389,66215
3.6," Unadkat to Anmolpreet Singh, , banged in short but miles wide outside off and the batter lets it go to earn that extra run. As a batter you would take everything and anything extra on this wicket ",1680877185006,66215
3.6," Unadkat to Anmolpreet Singh, no run, charges down the track and mistimes the shot down to mid-off ",1680877190138,66215
4.1," Krunal Pandya to Tripathi, no run, gets squared up and defends it out into the off-side ",1680877206847,66215
4.2," Krunal Pandya to Tripathi, 1 run, pats the ball down to mid-off for a single as that was on the sticks ",1680877217428,66215
4.2," Krunal Pandya to Tripathi, 1 run, pats the ball down to mid-off for a single as that was on the sticks ",1680877217428,66215

4.4," Krunal Pandya to Anmolpreet Singh, no run, spears one in, the batter gets his bat down and pats that wide of the bowler but they don't get a single ",1680877278845,66215
4.5," Krunal Pandya to Anmolpreet Singh, , angles it in, nice timing from Anmolpreet Singh earns him a four. The bat came down at an angle and he managed to punch that wide of mid-on for a four. Lovely timing and placement ",1680877292557,66215
4.6," Krunal Pandya to Anmolpreet Singh, , poor bowling from Krunal Pandya as he strays on to the pads of the batter. Anmolpreet Singh sits down and sweeps the ball over square leg for a four. That was well executed as he saw the fielder being inside the circle ",1680877330866,66215
4.6,,1680877403891,66215
5.1," Yash Thakur to Tripathi, , walks across, sits down, waits on the delivery and laps it over short fine. Had the time to preempt the shot. Got inside the line of the ball and put it away with elan ",1680877407251,66215
5.2," Yash Thakur to Tripathi, 1 run, walks across his sticks again and looks to paddle it. The ball comes off the cue-end of the bat and they scamper through for a single ",1680877482425,66215
5.2,"A very late review call by Anmolpreet Singh. That kept low as he missed the pull and the umpire's finger went up. Slower delivery, the batter was too early into the pull and missed it. Only thing is height which can save the batter. He has missed it by miles, so no chance of an inside edge. It is indeed going over. Anmolpreet Singh will survive",1680877485425,66215
5.2, Looks like a sluggish track. Low scoring game on our hands tonight,1680877485426,66215
5.3," Yash Thakur to Anmolpreet Singh, no run, Hawkeye shows it won't be dipping that much and Anmolpreet Singh has Tripathi to thank as his partner coaxed him to take the review with very few seconds left on the clock. That was a length delivery and Anmolpreet Singh went for the pull but got fooled by the lack of pace on it ",1680877606727,66215
5.4," Yash Thakur to Anmolpreet Singh, no run, and stabs the pull back to the bowler as that was at the sticks ",1680877653519,66215
5.4," Don't know what innovation this impact rule brings, but this is so confusing. Even the captains are not sure of their teams and strategies.",1680877653520,66215
5.5," Yash Thakur to Anmolpreet Singh, , poor delivery from Yash Thakur and put away easily. Was a fuller ball and Anmolpreet Singh clipped it past mid-on for a four. Lovely timing on it ",1680877687795,66215
5.6," Yash Thakur to Anmolpreet Singh, 1 run, jumps on to the short ball and pulls the ball down to deep square for a single ",1680877725434,66215
5.6,,1680877725444,66215
5.6,The first six overs will have more words about the pitch rather than the action so far. It would be tough to score on this deck.,1680877728434,66215

6.5," Ravi Bishnoi to Tripathi, 1 run, looks to drive and gets an inside edge on to the on-side for a single. Wanted to play that on the off-side and ended up sending it behind square on the on-side ",1680877926323,66215
6.6," Ravi Bishnoi to Anmolpreet Singh, 1 run, punches the ball down to long-on for a single. SRH won't be that disappointed with the start as the wicket has played some tricks so far ",1680877951545,66215
6.6,,1680878016613,66215
7.1," Krunal Pandya to Anmolpreet Singh, 1 run, spoons it over the bowler who ran back but failed to get there. The ball spun a little and held on to the surface a little as he tried to tuck that away on to the on-side ",1680878025304,66215
7.1," ""Why mark wood is not playing today. I hope there's no any injury concern."" -- Wood is unwell",1680878025305,66215

7.3," Krunal Pandya to Tripathi, no run, a risky shot for nothing. Went back, backed away, took it from the sticks to cut it but found the man at point ",1680878089337,66215
7.4," Krunal Pandya to Tripathi, 1 run, stabs the ball down with soft hands into the off-side for a single ",1680878110192,66215
7.4,Tripathi once again feels Anmolpreet Singh should review and he has. That was angled in and Anmolpreet Singh missed the tuck. The ball kept a little low and escaped the wood. Is it clipping the sticks? There is no bat confirms the UltraEdge. It is just about clipping the sticks. They lose Anmolpreet Singh but retain the review.,1680878113192,66215
7.4," Krunal Pandya to Anmolpreet Singh,  Lbw!! ",1680878224072,66215
7.5," Krunal Pandya to Anmolpreet Singh,  Lbw!! End of a decent knock I would reckon as batting hasn't been easy on this track. That was a flatter one, angled in and Anmolpreet Singh missed the tuck. The ball hit the back pad and was going on to clip the sticks. The onfield call was out and hence the original call stood. Important strike for LSG.  ",1680878226679,66215
7.5,,1680878295932,66215
7.5," Krunal Pandya to Markram,  Bowled!! ",1680878313340,66215
7.6," Krunal Pandya to Markram,  Bowled!! That's not beginner's luck for sure. Pitches, turns and the off-pole is lying flat on the deck. Markram pauses a little before realizing he is gone for a golden duck. That was a tossed up delivery, Markram didn't cover the line and looked to drive. The ball turned past the willow and turned enough to crash into the off-stick. Krunal has his third.  ",1680878314731,66215
7.6,,1680878419844,66215
8.1," Ravi Bishnoi to Tripathi, 1 run, angles it in from wide of the crease and tucks it down into the on-side for a single ",1680878424879,66215
8.1,Markram didn't move his feet much and paid the price for it. He could have been a little more committed to the shot.,1680878427879,66215
8.2," Ravi Bishnoi to Harry Brook, 1 run, stays low, hangs back and tucks the ball down on to the on-side for a single ",1680878469337,66215

8.4," Ravi Bishnoi to Harry Brook, 2 runs, dances down the track and fetches it from outside off to send it back past the bowler for a couple of runs. Good use of the feet by the young man ",1680878532778,66215

8.5," Ravi Bishnoi to Harry Brook,  Stumped!! ",1680878609359,66215
8.6," Ravi Bishnoi to Harry Brook,  Stumped!! Brook's intent won't work tonight. That wasn't the googly, Harry Brook danced down blind and missed the line of the ball to be out stumped. That turned away ever so slightly for the batter to be dismissed. Fourth one down for SRH. They are in deep trouble now. The batter tried to preempt the delivery but it went away for him to be out stumped.  ",1680878610341,66215
8.6,SRH in a deep hole now. Time-out has come at the right time for them. They have lost their last three in a quick span. The wicket has assisted spinners and has kept low as well. Even 130 will be a challenging total but will SRH be able to score that much?,1680878613341,66215

9.6," Hooda to Tripathi, , that's a superb shot! Top shot from a talented player. Was outside off, Tripathi opened the bat face and managed to get it past the man at point for a four. There isn't pace off the deck but Tripathi did well to infuse enough power into the shot ",1680878974434,66215

10.4," Ravi Bishnoi to Tripathi, 1 run, well played by Tripathi as he takes it from the sticks and nudges the ball down to mid-wicket. They thought of a couple before Tripathi sent Washington Sundar back ",1680879125166,66215
10.5," Ravi Bishnoi to Washington Sundar, no run, tossed up googly, the batter looks to clip it and misses. Was beaten in flight but that landed outside leg. The ball ricocheted on to the off-side and Tripathi wanted a single but was sent back ",1680879165848,66215
