1.6," Unadkat to Anmolpreet Singh, , and that has travelled alright! Was banged in short, Anmolpreet Singh swivelled on the back foot to pull it. Got a bit of a top-edge I reckon but that flew well over the fine leg fence. Travelled really high and far ",1680876545299
2.2," Krunal Pandya to Mayank, , sits down and gets it over the man at 45 degrees for a four. Was down on to his pads, he kneeled down and managed to get under the ball to lift it over the infield ",1680876645857
2.5," Krunal Pandya to Mayank,  Caught by Stoinis!! A soft dismissal. Not the first one you will see tonight. Got a big stride forward, looked to drive it aerially but failed to get it over the man at cover. Just a friendly chip and the man at cover leapt a little to take it. Easy take to send back Mayank. Was a tossed up delivery, outside off, the ball held on to the surface a little and Mayank was a little early into the shot.  ",1680876744943
4.5," Krunal Pandya to Anmolpreet Singh, , angles it in, nice timing from Anmolpreet Singh earns him a four. The bat came down at an angle and he managed to punch that wide of mid-on for a four. Lovely timing and placement ",1680877292557
4.6," Krunal Pandya to Anmolpreet Singh, , poor bowling from Krunal Pandya as he strays on to the pads of the batter. Anmolpreet Singh sits down and sweeps the ball over square leg for a four. That was well executed as he saw the fielder being inside the circle ",1680877330866
5.1," Yash Thakur to Tripathi, , walks across, sits down, waits on the delivery and laps it over short fine. Had the time to preempt the shot. Got inside the line of the ball and put it away with elan ",1680877407251
5.3," Yash Thakur to Anmolpreet Singh, no run, Hawkeye shows it won't be dipping that much and Anmolpreet Singh has Tripathi to thank as his partner coaxed him to take the review with very few seconds left on the clock. That was a length delivery and Anmolpreet Singh went for the pull but got fooled by the lack of pace on it ",1680877606727
5.5," Yash Thakur to Anmolpreet Singh, , poor delivery from Yash Thakur and put away easily. Was a fuller ball and Anmolpreet Singh clipped it past mid-on for a four. Lovely timing on it ",1680877687795
7.4," Krunal Pandya to Tripathi, 1 run, stabs the ball down with soft hands into the off-side for a single ",1680878110192
7.5," Krunal Pandya to Anmolpreet Singh,  Lbw!! End of a decent knock I would reckon as batting hasn't been easy on this track. That was a flatter one, angled in and Anmolpreet Singh missed the tuck. The ball hit the back pad and was going on to clip the sticks. The onfield call was out and hence the original call stood. Important strike for LSG.  ",1680878226679
7.6," Krunal Pandya to Markram,  Bowled!! That's not beginner's luck for sure. Pitches, turns and the off-pole is lying flat on the deck. Markram pauses a little before realizing he is gone for a golden duck. That was a tossed up delivery, Markram didn't cover the line and looked to drive. The ball turned past the willow and turned enough to crash into the off-stick. Krunal has his third.  ",1680878314731
8.6," Ravi Bishnoi to Harry Brook,  Stumped!! Brook's intent won't work tonight. That wasn't the googly, Harry Brook danced down blind and missed the line of the ball to be out stumped. That turned away ever so slightly for the batter to be dismissed. Fourth one down for SRH. They are in deep trouble now. The batter tried to preempt the delivery but it went away for him to be out stumped.  ",1680878610341
9.6," Hooda to Tripathi, , that's a superb shot! Top shot from a talented player. Was outside off, Tripathi opened the bat face and managed to get it past the man at point for a four. There isn't pace off the deck but Tripathi did well to infuse enough power into the shot ",1680878974434
13.1," Ravi Bishnoi to Washington Sundar, , leg spinner but goes down the leg side.  Nothing on Snicko and stays down the leg side, review wasted! ",1680879716616
14.6," Mishra to Tripathi, ,  A gift from Amit Mishra as he tosses up under the bat of Tripathi who slams it over the bowler's head for a straight boundary ",1680880326990
16.5," Mishra to Tripathi, ,  Tripathi anticipates the wide tossed up delivery and plays a reverse sweep over the infield, over backward point for a boundary!! ",1680880690996
17.2," Yash Thakur to Tripathi,  Caught by Mishra!! Banged in short but no pace on this surface and comes gently outside off. Tripathi tries to ramp it over short third but the lace of pace means he gets a very meak connection. Amit Mishra is the fielder in the circle who quickly shuffles to his left and takes a diving catch. Who said T20 was a young man's game?  ",1680880862671
17.3," Yash Thakur to Abdul Samad, , banged in short at regulation pace, Abdul Samad plays a first ball pull between deep square leg and deep mid-wicket. Starts with a boundary!! ",1680880958386
17.5," Yash Thakur to Washington Sundar, 1 run, another slower delivery. Sundar thought of the slog but decides to gently push it towards wide long-on for a single ",1680881045715
18.3," Mishra to Washington Sundar,  Caught by Hooda!! The first real big shot from Washington Sundar and he holes out!! Gently tossed up again, Sundar had to take it on. Gets a good enough connection towards long-on but these are big straight boundaries. Deepak Hooda is the fielder and he doesn't drop these kind of catches.   ",1680881235620
18.4," Mishra to Adil Rashid, , once again the new man gets a first ball four. Flighted with width, Rashid slams his drive through deep extra cover. Between the two deep fielders and goes for four... ",1680881310504
18.6," Mishra to Adil Rashid,  Caught by Hooda!! Tossed up delivery again, Adil Rashid danced out and went for a big drive down the ground. Catching practice for Deepak Hooda at long-off.  ",1680881367886
19.1," Unadkat to Abdul Samad,  Umran Malik Run Out!! 1 run completed Full outside off, comes slower than expected as Samad was through his drive early. Goes tamely past the bowler towards long-on. Umran Malik tries to go for a selfless second run but runs himself out. b]Umran Malik run out (Hooda/Unadkat) 0(0)[/b] ",1680881612017
19.2," Unadkat to Abdul Samad, , this could be very valuable!! Slower back of length delivery outside off. Abdul Samad takes it on and pulls it over long-on for a maximum. Came off the sweet spot ",1680881642476
19.5," Unadkat to Abdul Samad, , superb striking!! This was another pace off back of length delivery. Samad waits a long time and releases his pull at the right moment. Over deep mid-wicket and into the stands... ",1680881755323
0.3," Bhuvneshwar to Rahul, , a klassy shot from KL!! This was slightly pitched up, Rahul shimmies forward and plays a very well balanced cover drive through the gap for a boundary... ",1680882830505
1.1," Washington Sundar to Rahul, , lovely drive!! A poor overpitched delivery with width from Sundar and KL Rahul plays a superb drive through extra cover for a boundary ",1680883061521
1.5," Washington Sundar to Mayers, , pitched up on off, quicker again. Mayers plays the cover drive and gets it to the left of the fielder in the circle. Runs away for four... ",1680883207625
2.5," Fazalhaq Farooqi to Mayers, , slower length ball outside off, Mayers waits and waits, and then opens the bat surface to dab it towards third-man for a boundary. The short third fielder probably had a chance if he commited to the drive ",1680883521778
3.3," Markram to Rahul, , straying onto the pads, Rahul gets onto one knee and flicks it behind square. One bounce and four... ",1680883702420
4.3," Fazalhaq Farooqi to Mayers,  Caught by Mayank!! Big, big wicket!! This was a back of length delivery on off again. Mayers shuffles in to play the big pull. There was one man in the deep at deep square leg, and Mayers holes out to him. After two fifties, Kyle Mayers is gone cheaply today.  ",1680883944421
5.1," Bhuvneshwar to Hooda, , full and straight, no swing. Hooda dances out and lifts his drive very easily over the bowler's head. Lands short of the sightscreen... ",1680884253752
5.6," Bhuvneshwar to Hooda,  Caught&Bowled!! Gone! What a solid comeback by Bhuvi Kumar. Went for a six first ball but followed it up with four dots and a wicket. This was a length ball that got a bit of extra bounce, Hooda stepped out and was stuck in the middle, chipped it back to the bowler. A nice one-handed catch low to his left by the bowler. SRH need to keep the wickets coming...  ",1680884431095
6.2," Adil Rashid to Rahul, , shorter length on off. Rahul gets back and punches it through deep extra cover. There was a sweeper in place but always kept running away from him ",1680884603849
7.2," Markram to Krunal Pandya, , steps out, meets the pitch of this delivery and drives very sweetly through extra cover. Key was how well he used his feet to get to the ball ",1680884838314
8.6," Adil Rashid to Krunal Pandya, ,  Again good use of the feet from Krunal, helping him get right to the pitch of this flighted legbreak. And he follows it with a lovely swing through the line ",1680885164409
9.3,"T Natarajan to Krunal Pandya, , oh dear! Terrible from Umran in the deep! He goes for a one-handed pick-up but misses it completely, and the ball sneaks through for four! Slower length ball cutting in on off, Krunal backs away, makes room and drives nicely through extra cover. Should've only been two, but ",1680885509116
10.5," Umran Malik to Krunal Pandya, , back of a length delivery slanted in on middle, sits up nicely around the waist and Krunal pulls it through midwicket for four ",1680886023188
11.3," T Natarajan to Rahul, 1 run, 131.7kph, good length ball slanted in on off, Rahul punches it to long-off ",1680886265038
12.1," Umran Malik to Krunal Pandya, , 146.5kph from Umran, and Krunal just plants his front foot down the pitch and smashes it over mid-off! ",1680886448109
12.2," Umran Malik to Krunal Pandya,  Caught by Anmolpreet Singh!! Something to cheer for Umran. Good length outside off, it's at high pace and Krunal's feet go nowhere. He throws his bat at it, and nicks it through to Anmolpreet who hangs on. Umran spreads his arms and then punches the air enthusiastically.  ",1680886491897
12.3," Umran Malik to Stoinis, , again he strays in line. Length ball down leg, Stoinis hangs back and tickles it fine for four. Easy peasy ",1680886646159
13.4," Fazalhaq Farooqi to Stoinis, , low full toss on middle, Stoinis drives firmly down the ground and it races away to the boundary ",1680886961258
14.1," Adil Rashid to Rahul,  Lbw!! That must be out. Yes the finger goes up. But there's a review from Rahul. It's a legbreak that pitches around middle, straightens and hits the pad as Rahul misses the reverse-sweep. There's no bat involved and ball-tracking shows it's crashing into middle. Rahul knew he was gone and was walking off. He took the review just for the sake of it.  ",1680887256847
14.2," Adil Rashid to Shepherd,  Lbw!! Shepherd given out LBW first ball, and he has reviewed it as well. But it won't save him. It's clipping leg stump. A googly from Rashid, and Shepherd doesn't pick it at all. He's clueless on the back foot as the ball turns in sharply to beat the inside edge and hitting the back leg.  ",1680887403247
14.3," Adil Rashid to Pooran, , floated up at the stumps, Pooran gets down low for the sweep and it goes off the top-edge. Goes in the air but drops safely before running away to the boundary ",1680887488639
