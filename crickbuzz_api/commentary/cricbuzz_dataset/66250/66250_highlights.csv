0.3,"Akash Singh to Jaiswal, , so poor from Theekshana at third man. A back of a length delivery outside off, Jaiswal cuts and Theekshana gets across and slides to his left, the ball slips under the body, may have just overrun that too, the slide was unnecessary to be honest",1681308116759
0.4," Akash Singh to Jaiswal, , good length angling into middle and leg, Jaiswal flicks wide of mid-wicket and it races away. Good start ",1681308159142
1.4," Tushar Deshpande to Jaiswal,  Caught by Shivam Dube!! The hard back of a length into the pitch gets Jaiswal. He was in no position to play the pull, rushed by it, he miscues it off the splice and it's an easy catch for Dube at mid-off.  ",1681308469258
2.3," Theekshana to Padikkal, , Theekshana went round the wicket and bowled the offbreak full on the stumps, Padikkal gets forward and eases a lovely drive, all timing through extra-cover and no chance for long-off to his right ",1681308784936
2.4," Theekshana to Padikkal, , good delivery and MS applauds too, but it has run away for four to third man. A slower offbreak outside off, Padikkal reaches for it pokes it, the thick outside-edge flies wide of Mo and beats the chase of Akash ",1681308824764
4.2," Theekshana to Buttler, , tossed up offbreak outside off, in the slot, Buttler gets forward and knifes the loft over long-off ",1681309274090
4.4," Theekshana to Padikkal, , superb shot. Opens the off-side field by making room and then uses his hands to stay low and drive it wide of cover-point and extra-cover ",1681309334833
4.6," Theekshana to Buttler, , intentionally carved up and over the off-side field, flat back of a length delivery outside off, Buttler goes on the back foot and opens the face of the bat to get it over cover-point ",1681309410426
5.1," Tushar Deshpande to Padikkal, , Padikkal is looking to be aggressive in the powerplay. Makes room outside the leg-stump and forehands the slower ball wide of Dube at mid-off, raced away ",1681309473405
5.2," Tushar Deshpande to Padikkal, , poor delivery and put away. A slower ball down leg, Padikkal knows short fine is inside and flicks it wide of him. Easy boundary ",1681309509868

7.6," Moeen Ali to Buttler, , and again. Another short ball, Buttler sends the pull even further into the stands at deep mid-wicket, two gifts from his England mate and Buttler accepted it with glee ",1681310266910
8.3," Jadeja to Padikkal,  Caught by Conway!! Jadeja breaks the stand. Wider and across Padikkal, makes the left-hander fetch the slogsweep, a top-edge and Conway at deep backward square leg makes no mistake. CSK needed that wicket.  ",1681310395722
8.5," Jadeja to Samson,  Bowled!! What a cracker. Samson falls for a duck again. Fullish and quicker, drifting into middle and leg, Samson made the mistake of going back and then it turns from there, past the back foot block, the off-stump is knocked back. Fine over produces two wickets for CSK.  ",1681310626600
8.6," Jadeja to Ashwin, no run,  Tough chance and Jadeja is holding his hands on his head. Is Mo standing too far forward? This flies off a thick outside-edge as Ashwin looks to defend, went at chest-height, a couple of grabs from Mo and down it goes ",1681310745761
11.3," Magala to Ashwin, 2 runs, back of a length on the stumps, Ashwin flicks to the right of deep square leg and comes back for the second ",1681311329670
13.2," Theekshana to Ashwin, no run,  Ashwin comes down the track and miscues the drive to cover, is halfway down the track, Mo goes to his left and fumbles, then his throw is well wide of MS who can't get there even with a dive. Ashwin was well out too ",1681311935530
13.3," Theekshana to Ashwin, , Ashwin makes room outside the leg-stump and this is fired in full on the stumps, sliced between backward point and short third man ",1681311966702

14.3," Akash Singh to Ashwin, , into the crowd again. This is a good length delivery on the stumps, Ashwin heaves it and gets enough to clear deep mid-wicket. Stayed back and swung ",1681312221920
14.6," Akash Singh to Ashwin,  Caught by Magala!! Ashwin holes out. Full and wide outside off, sliced in the air and Magala at extra-cover takes it. Immediately looks at his fingers and calls for the physio. Hopefully he has not done something serious.  ",1681312418768
15.1,"Theekshana to Buttler, 2 runs,  Good length on middle, flicked to deep mid-wicket and placed well for a couple",1681312536732
16.2," Moeen Ali to Buttler,  Bowled!! Mo gets Buttler. No celebrations or anything from Mo. He has got the big wicket. Nicely tossed up offbreak outside off, Buttler goes for a big slogsweep and misses, the ball turns back in to hit off-stump.  ",1681312844399
17.5," Tushar Deshpande to Hetmyer, , Hetmyer has the hits. A low full-toss outside off, he gets across and biffs it over long-on, cleared the fielder on the fence ",1681313263056
17.6," Tushar Deshpande to Hetmyer, , the thick outside-edge helps. A slower ball across Hetmyer who swings to leg and the outside-edge clears short third man ",1681313332800
18.4," Akash Singh to Hetmyer, , Akash Singh misses the yorker, a high full-toss outside off, Hetmyer stays back and flat-bats the loft over the leaping long-on ",1681313555603
18.6," Akash Singh to Dhruv Jurel,  Caught by Shivam Dube!! The wide full-toss outside off works. Dhruv Jurel shuffles across and miscues it to long-off. They check for the height but it's below the waist so RR lose the review for they were the ones reviewing it.  ",1681313729912
19.1," Tushar Deshpande to Hetmyer, , half-volley outside off, Hetmyer stays deep and back, smashes it over Tushar Deshpande and straight down the ground ",1681313821303
19.3," Tushar Deshpande to Hetmyer, no run, again . This time for a wide outside off. Don't think they will get this either. Poor review as it's well inside the line on the off-side, a slower ball off-cutter outside off, Hetmyer slogs and misses ",1681313899862
19.5," Tushar Deshpande to Holder,  Caught by Conway!! Holder goes. A slower ball off-cutter outside off, Holder swings and miscues the heave, straight to the fielder at deep mid-wicket. Conway hangs on reverse-cup.  ",1681314020479
19.6,"Tushar Deshpande to Zampa,  Zampa Run Out!! 1 run completed. . Zampa shuffles across and scoops the slower ball to Theekshana at short fine-leg, a sitter is dropped but the batters try to steal a second, the throw to Dhoni is enough who flicks it on to the stumps catching Zampa well short. ",1681314172788
0.5," Sandeep Sharma to Gaikwad, , fraction short and angling in, Gaikwad holds a nice shape and pulls it backward of square leg ",1681315300008
2.2," Sandeep Sharma to Gaikwad,  Caught by Jaiswal!! No Boult, no problem. Sandeep provides the early breakthrough and it is the big wicket of the in-form Gaikwad. Angled in and Gaikwad wanted to whip it through the leg-side, but all he manages is a leading edge and the ball goes high, Jaiswal calls for it and hangs on to a good catch.  ",1681315786488
3.4," Holder to Rahane, , fraction short and Rahane is quick to latch on, he pulls off the front foot and though he got it high on the bat, the ball cleared mid-wicket comfortably and raced away to the fence ",1681316243816
3.6," Holder to Conway, , poor delivery and easily put away. Slanted down leg, Conway swivels and helps it along the way to long leg ",1681316317047
4.4," Zampa to Conway, , RR gifting some easy runs for Conway. This was very much like Holder's last ball - straying down leg, Conway sits down and sweeps it to fine leg. Not off the middle but who cares ",1681316486926
4.6," Zampa to Conway, ,  Tough chance but Sandeep got both hands. Conway goes for the sweep and hits it hard, Sandeep times his jump correctly but was not able to deal with the pace on the ball and allows it to burst through his fingers ",1681316541842
5.3," Ashwin to Rahane, ,  This has to be the shot of the match. Rahane shimmies down, gives himself room and lofts inside out. Not much flight and was pushed through but Rahane got under it and smoked it all the way ",1681316702188
6.5," Chahal to Conway, , half tracker and Conway does not miss out, he rocks back quickly and belts the pull to deep mid-wicket ",1681317008716

7.5," Holder to Rahane, 1 run, full delivery on leg-stump, Rahane flicks straight to deep backward square ",1681317317415
8.5," Zampa to Rahane, , lovely shot! This is Rahane at his best. He shimmies down, gets close to the pitch of the ball and drills the drive inside out through extra cover. The placement was spot on ",1681317735212
9.3," Ashwin to Rahane,  Lbw!! Ashwin breaks the partnership. Rahane and Conway have a discussion regarding the review, but looks like the former himself didn't want to send it upstairs. Carrom ball and Rahane premeditated the sweep, the length was too full and he ended up playing all over it, struck low on the pad and right in front of the stumps. That would have crashed into leg-stump and umpire Vinod Seshan made the right call.  ",1681318148718
11.3," Ashwin to Shivam Dube, , crunched! A bit short outside off, Shivam Dube flat-bats it through mid-off. No chance for long-off to cut it off. That was hit hard ",1681318868332
11.4,"Ashwin to Shivam Dube,  Lbw!!  Smart bowling from him. This one pitches on a length and skids through.

That certainly didn't look that way in real time. ",1681318943215
13.2," Zampa to Moeen Ali, 2 runs, a bit short outside off, cut away over backward point. The fielder in the deep runs to his right and keeps the batters down to a couple ",1681319431031
13.5,"Zampa to Moeen Ali,  Caught by Sandeep Sharma!! CSK are losing their way! Zampa gets his first wicket! The trial by spin is certainly taking a toll on CSK. Googly around leg, Moeen Ali goes for the slog sweep but doesn't get it off the middle of the bat. The ball skies towards deep backward square leg. Sandeep moves to his left, gets low, and manages to hold onto it. ",1681319532294
14.1," Chahal to Rayudu,  Caught by Hetmyer!! Another one bites the dust! The Impact player fails to make an impact. The flipper from Chahal and it's on a length on middle.

14.3," Chahal to Conway, ,  Full ball on off, Conway clears his front leg and heaves it away through wide mid-on. No chance for long-on to cut it off ",1681319841155
14.4," Chahal to Conway, 3 runs, full on leg, slog swept past the right of short fine leg. The fielder from the deep moves to his left and dives to stop a run for his side.  Has been a decent knock but he needs support ",1681319929140
14.6," Chahal to Conway,  Caught by Jaiswal!! Conway departs just after his Fifty! The asking rate has gone up over 12 and CSK are crumbling! Chahal pushes this one wider outside off, Conway has to reach out to it as he goes for a loft but gets it off the toe-end over extra cover. Jaiswal moves back, keeps his eyes on the ball, takes the catch, and then tumbles over.  ",1681320031928
17.1," Zampa to Dhoni, , poor ball and duly punished! Good start to the over. Down the leg side, Dhoni sweeps it away in the gap through backward square leg and the ball races to the fence ",1681320725032
17.4," Zampa to Dhoni, ,  Tossed up ball outside off, it's in the arc, Dhoni kneels down and with a free swing of the bat slog sweeps it over deep mid-wicket for a 84m six ",1681320826972
18.3," Holder to Jadeja, , full ball angling into Jadeja. He doesn't miss out and smashes it past Dhoni. No chance for long-on to cut it off.  ",1681321132153
18.4,"Holder to Jadeja,  A length ball on leg, right in the arc for Jadeja and he tonks it over fine leg for a maximum. Poor ball as there was no protection in the deep there",1681321234106
18.6," Holder to Jadeja, , in the arc, out of the park! Slot ball outside off, Jadeja smashes it down the ground and the ball clears the fence. 19 off the over ",1681321341241
