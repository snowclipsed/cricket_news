preview," CSK have returned to their fortress and they truly know how to rule the roost in their home conditions and it will certainly be a stern test for RR. MSD will be leading CSK for the 200th time in the IPL and it is a big occasion for him tonight. After losing their opening game, CSK have won two games in a row. RR also have two wins out of three games. With a chance to top the table on offer, expect a humdinger of a contest. If the Chepauk surface plays true to its nature, expect spin to play a substantial part. In the last game here, we saw more than 420 runs scored. Even Dhoni was surprised by the way the surface played but saying all that, the spinners did extract good purchase. These two teams have ticked most boxes so far. Will Dhoni lead CSK to a hat-trick of wins in today's historic game? Or will RR breach CSK's fortress? Stay with us as toss and team lineups will be out in a while..",1681303729206,66250

preview,"Lots of cracks, not a lot of grass. The surface is firm enough here but fully expect the spinners and cutters to play a major role in this type of surface.

In the game against LSG, the spinners extracted good turn. It is going to turn and there will be a bit of bounce too.

preview," We will bowl first. It maybe slightly on the slower side, different from the first game. Dew may play a role and it might get better in the second innings. (On his 200th game as CSK captain in the IPL) It feels good and also I feel the crowd has been fantastic. Also the fact that we started in the old stadium, it was very hot and humid. But now it feels like we're playing in Switzerland. It's good to play. We have seen cricket change - how T20 was played at that point of time till now, a lot has changed. The crowd has been fantastic. We have had injury concerns and players were unavailable, but still we have done well. ",1681306231124,66250

preview," I guess seeing what the surface is like at the time, last time we played here it was a new wicket, I haven't played here for quite a while, but there was a little bit more bounce than compared to some other Indian wickets. I found out this wicket has bounce (while playing for Australia), had a warm-up bowl now and it looks like it is doing the same thing. If we bowl second and it gets wet then it changes the game. Lot of planning goes into it, as a young man I was negligent but I have played a lot of cricket now and you have to bowl to guys' weaknesses, bit of planning and then backing my skill. It is all new to the game and we are trying to work it out ourselves, the new sub rules can change the game quickly, just being ready and grabbing the opportunity when it comes. I have played with Yuzi before as well, we sit back after the game and discuss what we could have done better, we have done that for the last couple of years and are happy to help each other.",1681307086652,66250
preview," (On what has worked for CSK) The important guys have performed really well, Rutu is in good form, Jadeja is in good form, Santner has bowled really well in the last three games. As a group, we are performing really well and the guys are putting up their hands. Ajinkya coming in his first game and putting in a man of the match performance, we can’t expect anything better from the team and hopefully we can continue tonight. (On his bowling plans) The boundaries are a bit bigger on the squarer side, so force the batters to hit on the square options. Change of pace always a good option. The previous wicket played really good so let’s see how the wicket plays tonight. (On playing under MSD) The calmness he brings to the team, then also the excitement of the crowd, every game feels like a home game. It is awesome to play under him and may he play for many more years to come.",1681307086662,66250

But because we lost a few wickets, I had to extend a partnership and take it deeper. It is disappointing to get out in the death. But we got a good score.

post," The RR players have held their nerves, to win by only 3 runs! Dhoni and Jadeja tried their best but couldn't pull off a fairytale win for CSK! Gaikwad got out early but Conway and Rahane stitched a 50-run stand together, keeping the scoreboard ticking. But, the spinners were getting grip and turn as expected and they kept the run rate in check. It was always going to be a battle against spin on this track and Chahal and Ashwin rose to the occasion. In their combined 8 overs, they only conceded 52 runs and took 4 wickets. CSK kept losing wickets due to the asking rate rising but Jadeja and Dhoni gave the hosts a last ray of hope! 40 was needed off the last 2 overs! Holder was taken away for 19 runs in the penultimate over. 20 was needed off the last over and Dhoni would have backed himself. Sandeep missed his mark and he was hit for two consecutive sixes. But, he delivered yorkers when it was needed and Dhoni couldn't finish it off. Stick around for the presentations..",1681322026457,66250

post," I think in the middle overs we needed a bit more strike rotation, there wasn't much for the spinners but they had experienced spinners and we could not rotate strike. It was not that difficult and the ownership (of the loss) should come from the batters. It was good that we could reach striking distance (of the target) as we were the last pair. It really affects NRR when you get to the last phase of the tournament. You see the field, see the bowler and what the bowler is trying to do, after that just stand still and wait for them to commit the mistake, if they bowl in good areas then good luck to them. I would wait for it and that is something which has worked for me, you need to back your strength and my strength is to hit straight. There was a bit of dew and once the ball went to the outfield it became easier for the batters. Overall I was very happy with the bowlers. I really didn't know it was my 200th (game as CSK skipper) and milestones don't really matter for me, it is about how you're performing and the results.",1681322026468,66250

Zampa has played for Australia and we keep discussing in the nets as to how to bowl. Sandeep backed himself and when Mahi bhai is batting, you need to have self-belief and Sandeep pulled it off and that is why runs were not scored.

I don't have good memories at Chepauk, never won here and wanted to win today. The ball was gripping and hence, we brought Zampa in as the impact player. We had a good powerplay with Rutu getting out and the thought was if we can get out of the powerplay without giving away too much then we have the spinners to do the job. Last two overs were tensed, I tried to push it deep but you are never safe with I0$. You have to have respect for that guy and to what he can do. Nothing works against him.",1681323168719,66250

post," I surprise people I guess. Whenever I walk out to bat, people assume I just took that decision and came out, but that's a role given to me, we lost Sanju and I had to do a job. I am far better at judging my strengths, I take a few balls to get going. Every batting innings, I am padded up from the start. It's not an easy thing but it is good. I came off with good Test form. I feel I am able to get good grip and drop on the ball at the right lengths. If I was not able to do those things in the two years (with Punjab Kings) then I wouldn't be able to do it here. Success or failure, it has to be on my own terms.",1681323468879,66250
