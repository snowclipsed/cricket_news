preview," Day three of the IPL and two other teams get to play their opening game of the season. Two teams that many experts are already calling the favorites to make the playoffs. Certainly two of the most balanced sides this season in terms of combinations and options. Yes, I’m talking about Sunrisers Hyderabad and Rajasthan Royals.",1680426046536,66183
preview,"First to the hosts, who have a new old captain leading today with the South African trio of Markram, Jansen and Klaasen missing. Their absence actually means it easy to slot in their overseas picks, as SRH need to pick four out of their five available foreigners, with Farooqi most likely to miss out. This could include an SRH debut for Adil Rashid and Glenn Phillips, and an IPL debut for England's wow talent Harry Brook. Add to that a top-order of Mayank Agarwal, an in-form Abhishek Sharma and Rahul Tripathi coupled with a solid core of Indian pacers, SRH really look a scary prospect this year in the IPL.",1680426061082,66183
preview,"And now to the visitors and runners-up Rajasthan Royals. They've retained the bulk of that roster, roped in Jason Holder who will be that bridge player between the bowlers and batters. Holder's inclusion makes the Rajasthan team balance a lot more solid, as they already have two reliable spinners in Ashwin and Chahal, and have Trent Boult for the powerplays. Up top, Jos Buttler and Yashasvi Jaiswal are both in good nick, and skipper Sanju Samson will be eyeing this season as a potential gateway back into the Indian team. Two power-packed squads, plus plenty of options as substitutes - we should have a cracker of a game! Stay tuned for toss and team updates...",1680426073107,66183
preview," Once again a fantastic venue, the pitch is more or less central- pretty even boundaries all along. The pitch looks pristine, a bit like how an English pitch would be, covered by dried grass and white in color. There won't be ready-made turn for for the spinners. Hyderabad has been a high-scoring venue, teams that have won chasing have an average score of 190. So that tells you this is a venue where you are better off chasing, because sometimes in the pressure to get runs on the board you end up with just 150-160. The pitch is perfect, one where you would want to chase. In the afternoon, maybe there might be some turn, quips ",1680426810603,66183

preview," We are very excited, it’s the first match. Definitely, when you do well, it helps the team. I have had a very good partnership with Ashwin last year and we would like to continue that. We need to win games consistently and we need to work hard in every game as our goal is to not only reach the playoffs but reach the top two. We would have to travel a lot, as there will be home and away games and there will be back-to-back games. It’s a new journey for us, so the focus is on present.

preview," I am looking forward to the IPL, hopefully we are going to have a packed crowd here. The stadium looks awesome, they were painting it the other day, all orange so it’s good to be out here. Haven’t played much T20 cricket since the World Cup so hopefully I can go out there and hit a few off the middle, get to a decent score and contribute to the team. (On Adil Rashid) He is world-class and he is one of the best bowlers in the world for a reason. He is a wicket-taker, just like most legspinners but he is a very clever bowler and watches the batters hard and tries to adapt to what the batters are doing. So, he is going to be an extremely good addition to the team. (On missing a few key players initially) We are missing the captain so it is a big miss, but they have got other commitments. I am sure they will slide in perfectly into the side in a couple of games. We have to focus on this game for now and we are looking forward to it.",1680428968802,66183
preview,"We had a really good last year but it is very much about starting fresh. It is about playing what is in front of us and focusing on the here and now. (On Holder) He brings some good balance with the bat and the ball, it is fantastic to have in T20 cricket. The Impact Player rule adds another dynamic. (On Prasidh Krishna’s injury) Disappointing for him to be injured but it gives someone else an opportunity to step up. (On the importance of playing spin well) It is very important. It has been a prevalent part in T20 cricket wherever you play so it is exciting to play in different venues - that is part of what makes the IPL special.",1680428968812,66183

Jaiswal got out after his fifty and SRH fought back with wickets but Samson was there and he reached his fifty to continue his good run in the IPL in his side's opening games of the season. At the end, SRH bowled well and kept it down to 203 with good death bowling from Natarajan and Farooqi. Still 203 will take some chasing even though the wicket is good and the outfield is fast. Advantage RR at the moment. Back for the chase shortly...",1680436074749,66183

post," IPL cricket returned to Hyderabad after four years, the stadium was filled with orange but the colour began to fade as the game started, with a few pink and purple hues emerging. A case of Murphy's law for Sunrisers, who were given a drubbing by the Rajasthan openers as they conceded their highest powerplay tally. Samson got a fifty as well, as RR finished with a solid first innings score. In reply, SRH were given a 'Boult from the pink' as their in-form batters Rahul Tripathi and Abhishek Sharma fell for ducks. Harry Brook had a forgettable IPL debut as well, as the spinners began their stranglehold. Mayank Agarwal showed some promise but perished against Chahal, and the rest of the middle-order failed to contribute much. It took a few late tonks from the impact player Abdul Samad and Umran Malik to get SRH to a respectable total, while even crossing 100 looked a challenge at one point.",1680443494385,66183

post,"For Rajasthan, as perfect a game as they could have had. Their openers got runs as Buttler and Jaiswal started off from where they left last season. Samson got his customary good start to the IPL. Trent Boult picked powerplay wickets, Yuzi Chahal got a four-fer and Ravi Ashwin bowled economically. Their debutant Jason Holder had a good game with the bowl and in the field, and wasn’t needed to bat. They even got their rookie bowler KM Asif to bowl out without much pressure, and got a returning Navdeep Saini to get some game practice. Onto the presentations now...",1680443494395,66183

post,"100 per cent we can say that, let's forget and move on, the way we pulled back in the last 6 overs and Umran's cameo at the end. We did not bowl pretty well, first match of the season and a lot to improve. South Africans are coming back and we definitely will be a much better batting side, we have to move forward from this game. It was a pretty good track, we can prepare what we want but we are not worried about that.",1680443851902,66183

post,"Definitely the start we wanted. The way Jos and Jaiswal batted, we knew a big score will always be difficult to score. The plan was to bowl stump to stump, tossing it up is my strength.

post," Was wondering how we'll start this season, very happy with this. Having batters like Buttler and Jaiswal, the mindset with which they play the powerplay we can expect such starts. We are a very good side, but you know this format. So we need to keep our heads down. Today was a very good start but we are looking at finishing things well. For me, today I wanted to stay there and finish the innings. We will find out if there are any weaknesses as the tournament goes on (chuckles).",1680444381080,66183
