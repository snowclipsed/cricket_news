0.2,"Bhuvneshwar to Jaiswal, , Bhuvneshwar goes a tad fuller onto off, Jaiswal with a gentle push down the ground that beats Brook's dive at mid-off. The outfield does the rest to allow for the first boundary",1680429743138
1.1," Fazalhaq Farooqi to Jaiswal, , too full on the boots and what an elegant flick between mid-wicket and mid-on from Jaiswal. Signs of a man in form says Harsha Bhogle on air!! ",1680430029888

2.1," Bhuvneshwar to Buttler, , effortless!! Bhuvneshwar errs too full in the swinging arc of Buttler. Just a casual flick over mid-wicket from the English captain and that sails away for an 81-metre six!! ",1680430355065
2.4," Bhuvneshwar to Jaiswal, , slightly slower and on the pads, clipped past the close-in mid-wicket fielder and mid-on gives it a despairing dive but Jaiswal picks up another four!! ",1680430490821
2.5," Bhuvneshwar to Jaiswal, , shoddy fielding!! This is short pitched on off, Jaiswal with a cute ramp over the keeper. Didn't come off the middle and Malik at short third had two efforts to pull the ball back but fails both times... ",1680430528847
3.1," Washington Sundar to Buttler, , too short on middle stump, allows Buttler to rock back and pull powerfully over deep square leg to welcome Washington Sundar with a six!! ",1680430689643
3.2," Washington Sundar to Buttler, , short again, off the backfoot again, heaved again. This one goes even longer and higher, over long-on this time for six more... ",1680430719013
3.4," Washington Sundar to Buttler, 1 run, Washington goes fuller, Buttler takes it on with a slog sweep. Doesn't time it cleanly and gets to deep mid-wicket on the bounce. The fielder might have had a chance had he gone for the dive ",1680430786873
3.5," Washington Sundar to Jaiswal, , full and straying down leg, Jaiswal shuffles in and sweeps it behind square for a boundary!! ",1680430839870

4.3," T Natarajan to Buttler, , full and angling away from Buttler, in the slot and allows Buttler to free his arms, gets forward and opens the face of the bat on the loft, gets it over the off-side field ",1680431071576
4.4," T Natarajan to Buttler, , too much width outside off, shortish outside off, Buttler cuts and beats backward point on the dive to his right, relied on timing more than anything else ",1680431107815
4.5," T Natarajan to Buttler, , this is carnage from Buttler. Length delivery wide outside off, Buttler gets forward and thrashes the drive, extra-cover dives to his left but no chance as it was hit so hard ",1680431149309
5.1," Fazalhaq Farooqi to Buttler, , Buttler is toying with SRH. An off-pace short ball on the stumps, Buttler delays the pull and pulls it wide of deep square leg to his right ",1680431272071
5.3," Fazalhaq Farooqi to Buttler, ,  This was a catch to slip but such is the scoring rate that there's no chance of a slip, short of length outside off, Buttler slashes and the thick outside-edge flies wide of Glenn Phillips ",1680431338478
5.4," Fazalhaq Farooqi to Buttler, , the attempted yorker on the stumps, is a low full-toss, Buttler gets forward to drive wide of mid-off, opened the face to get that in the gap ",1680431377739
5.5," Fazalhaq Farooqi to Buttler,  Bowled!! Such a massive wicket that. SRH strike and get rid of the dangerous Buttler. A hard back of a length delivery on the stumps, nips back in ever so slightly, Buttler stays leg-side to punch, the pace beats him and clips the top of off-stump. The off-bail goes away and that's relief for SRH.  ",1680431416901
6.6," Adil Rashid to Jaiswal, , short but extra bounce outside off, Jaiswal delays the cut and leaves backward point and short third man ball-watching with a superb cut ",1680431902345

7.4," Umran Malik to Samson, , it has flown away due to Umran Malik's extra pace, short of length delivery outside off, Samson opens the face of the bat and runs it down fine to third man, beats the fielder quickly ",1680432145386
9.1," Umran Malik to Jaiswal, , wow! A half-volley outside off, Jaiswal gets forward and crashes that with brutal power through cover-point, no chance for sweeper cover ",1680432533919
9.4," Umran Malik to Samson, , good short ball at Samson who just pulled and got a fat top-edge that sails away over Glenn Phillips, all the way too ",1680432649269
10.1," Adil Rashid to Samson, , dragged down and Samson doesn't miss out. Rocks back and pulls to the crowd at deep mid-wicket ",1680432794189

12.1," Fazalhaq Farooqi to Jaiswal, , fantastic from Jaiswal. Fazalhaq Farooqi did well to follow him outside the leg-stump with a full delivery, Jaiswal drills that with lots of bottom-hand and gets it wide of mid-off ",1680433304852
12.3," Fazalhaq Farooqi to Jaiswal,  Caught by Mayank at deep mid-wicket!! Fazalhaq Farooqi gets his 2nd. Dug in short and Jaiswal totally miscued the pull, toe-ends it and finds deep mid-wicket. End of a good knock but now he has to go.  ",1680433461275
13.1," Washington Sundar to Samson, , what a blow. This is a length offbreak that turns in, Samson goes on the back foot and makes it shorter than what it really is, generates great power to flat-bat it way over long-off. Exceptional hit ",1680433705479
13.5," Washington Sundar to Samson, 1 run, flat offbreak on a back of a length outside off, Samson punches to sweeper cover who gets across and cuts it off ",1680433861684
14.1," Umran Malik to Padikkal,  Bowled!! Umran Malik cleans up Padikkal and instead of his trademark punch the air celebration, he stops midway and smiles at Padikkal with a big dimple dotting the pacer's face. Lovely. No feet from Padikkal as it stays low from a good length and skids from there, uproots off-stump after beating the defence. SRH fighting back.  ",1680433983259
14.2," Umran Malik to Riyan Parag, , my word! Short and wide outside off, Riyan Parag does not hold back, smashes the cut and it's nearly all the way over deep cover, one bounce over the ropes. That is some shot ",1680434102450
15.1," Adil Rashid to Samson, , that's too much flight, tossed up full outside off, in the slot, Samson lofts clean and nice over long-off ",1680434380603
15.4," Adil Rashid to Samson, no run,  A thick inside-edge as Samson gets forward to loft and yes it did carry to Farooqi who dived to his right but can't hang on ",1680434492084
16.1,"T Natarajan to Riyan Parag,  Caught by Fazalhaq Farooqi!! The timeout takes a wicket. How often does that happen. A length delivery, the slower off-cutter across Riyan Parag who gets forward to heave and a thick outside-edge goes straight up, Farooqi at short third man goes back and hangs on this time. ",1680434796185
16.3," T Natarajan to Samson, 1 run,  Another slower ball off-cutter outside off, driven wide of extra-cover ",1680434946548
17.3," Bhuvneshwar to Hetmyer, ,  A slower ball short ball dug in, Hetmyer waits and thumps it way back over deep square leg, sports a smile after hitting that ",1680435228765

18.1," T Natarajan to Hetmyer, no run,  Good yorker on the stumps, dug out to cover, Hetmyer was halfway down when he was sent back, he gave up, but Bhuvi's lob misses and Hetmyer survives ",1680435394364
18.3," T Natarajan to Samson,  Caught by Abhishek Sharma!! Superb balancing act with the left-foot from Abhishek at deep mid-wicket and he sends Samson back. A back of a length delivery outside off, Samson swiped and nearly got it all the way, Abhishek was there on the edge of the cushions, takes it and then juggles his left-foot beautifully to not touch the skirting.  ",1680435534681
18.4," T Natarajan to Ashwin, byes, , sloppy from Glenn Phillips, T Natarajan beats Ashwin with a slower ball across him, Phillips does not get the body behind as he dives forward, gives away four needless runs ",1680435617990

0.3," Boult to Abhishek Sharma,  Bowled!! What an outswinging yorker. Peach. Boult at his best. Abhishek Sharma helped him by staying leg-side of the ball as he tried to dig it out, the ball swings away and knocks back off-stump. Perfect start for RR.  ",1680437101593
0.5," Boult to Tripathi,  Caught by Holder!!  Tripathi is going nowhere. He thinks it is a bump-ball. Surprisingly Tripathi reviews and umpire KN Anantha Padmanabhan is having a word with the batter. Is this an umpire's review or a batter's review? It is the batter's. Outstanding catch by the tall Holder, stretching his left-hand and grabbing it at a wide slip. Tripathi came down the track and opened the face on this full outswinger outside off, guided it wide of Holder but the big man just plucked it from thin air.  SRH lose their review too.  ",1680437275691
1.4," KM Asif to Harry Brook, , slower ball full outside off, Harry Brook stands and delivers, reaches for it and slams it wide of mid-off ",1680437751589

5.6," Ashwin to Mayank, , well played! Tossed up ball, drifting in, Mayank kneels down and lap sweeps it past the left side of short fine to find the fence ",1680438780889
6.6,"Chahal to Harry Brook,  Bowled!!  300 wickets for Chahal in T20s, informs the on air commentator. He bowls it quicker and flatter on off, perhaps the flipper. Harry Brook expects it to spin away as he rocks back in an attempt to cut it square of the wicket on the off-side. Is done in by the skidiness on the ball and the ball crashes into the off-stump. SRH are in a lot of trouble now. ",1680439024329
8.2," Holder to Washington Sundar,  Caught by Hetmyer!!  The short ball proves to be the undoing for Sundar! Holder hits the deck hard and doesn't provide any room to the batter to play with. Although he is cramped for room, he goes for a pull across the line but ends up getting it off the toe-end of the bat. The ball lobs up towards mid-off. Hetmyer charges in from extra cover and takes it safely.  ",1680439538635
8.5," Holder to Glenn Phillips, , shot! Holder once again goes short but it sits up nicely for Glenn Phillips. He stands tall and pulls it over deep square leg for a maximum. Held his shape nicely there ",1680439827869
9.3," Ashwin to Glenn Phillips,  Caught by KM Asif!!  Ashwin joins the party as well and has a big smile on his face. Tossed up full ball outside off, luring Glenn Phillips to go for an audacious stroke. He obliges and goes for a full-fledged uppish drive but he makes the mistake of hitting it straight to extra cover. Also, he got it off the bottom half of the bat. KM Asif stationed there takes a sharp catch.  ",1680440018431
10.2," Chahal to Abdul Samad, 1 run, fraction short outside off, punched against the spin to long-on ",1680440297679
10.6," Chahal to Mayank,  Caught by Buttler!! The procession conttinues for SRH! Wrong 'un on a full length outside off, Mayank gets low in his stance attempting to slog-sweep it. All he manages is to slice it off the toe-end of the bat towards long-off and Buttler is safe as houses.  ",1680440403674
11.6," Ashwin to Adil Rashid, , that's a terrific shot! Tossed up ball, Adil Rashid uses his feet and smashes it down the ground straight as an arrow. Clears the fence with ease ",1680440719996
12.3," Navdeep Saini to Adil Rashid, , a low full-toss on middle and leg, Adil Rashid whips it away over mid-wicket. Finds the gap between the two men in the deep and gets a boundary off the Free Hit ",1680441104192
13.6," Chahal to Adil Rashid,  Stumped!! Adil Rashid uses his feet and Chahal bowls it wider and slower through the air. Adil Rashid swings at it ages early and misses. An easy stumping for Samson. Strangely, it has been taken usptairs to check for a stumping. The replay confirms that Adil Rashid was miles out.  ",1680441450589
17.5," Chahal to Bhuvneshwar,  Bowled!! That's a fourth for Yuzi!! Looks like that Purple Cap might never leave him... This was flat and turned the other way. Bhuvneshwar backed away for a big hit and played the wrong line, losing his stumps in the process.  ",1680442754630
18.4," Boult to Umran Malik, , length ball on off, lands nicely for Umran Malik to clear his front leg and tonk over mid-off for a boundary ",1680443036132
18.5," Boult to Umran Malik, , a rare cheer for the home ground!! This was in the slot on middle, Umran Malik was hanging back in his crease and heaves it leg side. Goes deep into the stands over deep mid-wicket. SRH get past their lowest IPL score ",1680443067789
19.1," Navdeep Saini to Abdul Samad, , gentle slot ball on middle and leg, Abdul Samad clears his legs and whacks it over deep square leg. Six more!! ",1680443186389
19.3," Navdeep Saini to Umran Malik, , , Shot of the match!! Comes a little too late. This was banged in shorter and Umran Malik backs up and absolutely heaves that over deep mid-wicket. And to make it worse it is a no ball ",1680443345472
19.4," Navdeep Saini to Abdul Samad, , full and wide, Abdul Samad opens his bat face and deposits this through point. One bounce and over the fence... ",1680443421870
19.5," Navdeep Saini to Abdul Samad, , slower one on the pads, Samad clips it to the left of short fine for another boundary. ",1680443444074
