10.1," Lalit Yadav to Kohli,  Caught by Yash Dhull!! oops.... Virat Kohli gets out to a juicy full toss. This looked destined for a six as Kohli backed away for a big heave leg side.

10.4," Lalit Yadav to Maxwell, , Lalit Yadav flights it up just outside off. In the slot for Maxwell and he wasn't holding back. Swings across the line and puts all muscle behind it, and the ball sails over long-on... We're going to need a new ball ",1681555621864

Dinesh Karthik's lean patch continues, he generally waits a couple of balls before going for the big shots, even when he comes later on in the innings.

0.4,"Siraj to Prithvi Shaw,  Prithvi Shaw Run Out!! A direct hit from RCB's impact player and Shaw is OUT. That's a sensational bit of fielding from the man who just made all the wrong headlines,. On a good length and just outside off - Shaw stays on the back-foot and pushes it to the right of cover, the single was always on, but Rawat skipped across to his right, dived and made a one-handed stop, gets up and then throws down the stumps at the bowler's end, catching Shaw well short of his crease.

8.5," Harshal Patel to Abishek Porel,  Caught by Parnell!! Another leading edge and Abishek has holed out to mid-on - was a slower full-toss, dipped onto Abishek and messed up with his timing - he was looking to whip, gets undone by the late dip and is through with the shot early, pops off the leading edge and it's another simple catch to Parnell, right at the edge of the ring.
