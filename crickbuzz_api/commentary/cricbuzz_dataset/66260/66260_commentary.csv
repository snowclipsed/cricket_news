preview," On a scorching Saturday afternoon in Bengaluru, the Royal Challengers and the Delhi Capitals will try to get back to winning ways. The hosts for today are on a 2-match losing spree while it's worse for the visitors who're even more badly placed, having lost all their four matches so far. RCB's bowling as usual has come into question especially after having allowed the Knight Riders to reach 204 from 89 for 5 and then letting Lucknow chase down 213 after being at 23 for 3 at one stage. It's always under the microscope, especially at the Chinnaswamy and they'll need a quick turnaround if they're to stop the slide. In that regard, the return of Wanindu Hasaranga could solve some problems, the Sri Lankan leg-spinner could be the glue that'd control the middle overs.",1681467443596,66260
preview,"With RCB playing 6 of their first 8 matches at home, wins at the Chinnaswamy could give them a head start before their 5 consecutive away games. The Capitals are also on another extreme. Nothing much has gone their way - Prithvi Shaw has been a pale shadow of his previous best, the middle-order has looked volatile in the absence of Rishabh Pant and David Warner has been forced to play the role of an anchor. With runs being at a premium, the bowling attack hasn't quite been able to deliver. However, they couldn't have asked for a better surface than that at the Chinnaswamy to try and start a winning run.",1681467443606,66260
preview,"'We're playing at the pitch number 8 and the square boundaries are at 61m and 66m while the straight boundary on one side is 70m. The average 1st innings score in afternoon games here is 157, it looks dry and there shouldn't be a lot of lateral movement,' reckon , in their pitch report.",1681549116828,66260
preview,"'Josh Hazlewood is here. Obviously he isn't warming up or anything. Unlikely to play even the next one but he has a long chat with compatriots Marsh and Warner', pings our man  from the ground",1681549665398,66260
preview," I think the couple of losses are there, but we have been playing some good cricket. Just a few overs away from a few more good performances. We’ve come here today and we’re looking to turn that form around and chalk up another win. There has been some dew here, so there might be some tail towards the back end, we’ve not been at our best so far but hopefully we get some lateral movement towards the back end. The ball going sideways could help us out. The important thing is doing the basics well, if you smash hard lengths then it will be tough. Fielding is one thing we’ve spoken about in our meetings, it is something we control and our intensity and movements are something we pride ourselves on, so we’ll be looking to back that up today.",1681550825239,66260
preview," Four matches have not gone well, but we've kept things simple. It's time to upgrade our skills. This is a very important game. A win can get you into rhythm, which we're trying to find. We are like a family. The environment is good, it's a matter of one win. Of course there is disappointment of losing four in a row despite such good players. But we've forgotten about the four defeats, and are approaching this game as a fresh start. Have tried different things in these four matches, but nothing has worked out (with the bat). So today I've come in with a blind mindset. Will see the ball and play my natural game.",1681550873465,66260

preview," We are going to bowl first. The ground looks incredible, credit to the staff here. It's about getting one win, the momentum follows from there. We don't want to lose wickets in the powerplay. We have change. ",1681551034878,66260
preview, Would have done the same. Hopefully it will turn in the second innings. This stays a good wicket generally. Will be important for me and Virat to assess the conditions early. It's difficult to defend in death overs. We have been good at our home ground as a batting unit. You got to pick your best batters and bowlers. ,1681551087805,66260

post," What a performance from the RCB seamers to defend the total convincingly! RCB were really poor with the way they handled things with the bat towards the end of their innings, and how they used their impact sub. But that seems a long time ago now. Their bowling, which is often accused of not stepping up, bailed them out today. Majority of the damage was done in the powerplay itself with Siraj and Parnell steaming in as the Capitals were reduced to 2/3. And then came Vijaykumar Vyshak to produce a brilliant spell on debut! He got rid of David Warner who was starting to look dangerous, before getting rid of the in-form Axar Patel. The final nail was the wicket of Manish Pandey, getting trapped LBW by Hasaranga who wasn't having a great game until then. The pitch was on the slower side, definitely not a belter that we see in the evening games here. And the batting woes from the Capitals continued.  for them now, with things looking quite grim.",1681566036947,66260

post," - I didn't know about that (on having the best bowling figures on debut for an RCB bowler), have been working hard for the opportunity. Faf came and told me the wicket was holding up a bit, so I went with the hard lengths and slower balls which worked well. I've been working on these variations for the last couple of years. I wanted to bowl the knuckle ball, but Faf came up with suggestions on how to go about on this pitch. The management backed me well and Faf came up with suggestions often to help me. I was with the team as a net bowler",1681566289159,66260

post," I said at the toss we needed to do all disciplines well, but we lost three early wickets and we didn't chase down what should have been an easy chase. They (RCB) came out and started well with the ball, Siraj was outstanding. The positives were good - bowling and fielding was exceptional, the energy we showed was great too. Have to go back, we have five days off, have a hard look at ourselves, we need to do better with the bat and build partnerships at the top of the order. It is a matter of starting well with the bat. Teams have come back well from this position before and we can go on and do better.",1681566541261,66260

post," We needed that to get the confidence back in the group. Especially the bowling group. Unfortunately we've had to defend for a few games in a row now, and it's not always easy at the Chinnaswamy. So very proud of them tonight. It's the first day game of the season. Also the new rule now - you always feel you need more. 175 in a day game here is a good score. But with the new rule there's some uncertainty. it proved to be the right score. But the way we bowled in the first six overs, not only today - in all the games. Siraj setting the tone beautifully. Generally the first six overs is most important with the bat. You want to play positive and get ahead of the rate. The way we bowled was just unbelievable. Huge credit to our seamers in the first six.",1681567024949,66260

post," It was a tricky one. When it went up in the air, I made sure there was no one close to me. I made sure I grabbed it solidly. I was quite disappointed that I got out to a full toss. I've been playing really well. I wanted to make sure that after fifty, I was targetting 30-35 runs off the next 10 balls. That's how I play. That would've helped us get past 200. One thing I mentioned to the guys in the change room that 175 was enough on this pitch. It slowed down considerably when the spinners came on. Even the balls to hit off the back foot off Kuldeep were holding up, unlike the other games we played. We did well to get to that score and had the belief it was enough. When I've played my best cricket, those are the balls I've put away consistently (length balls on the up). That helps me to put pressure on the bowlers. When I put away their best balls, they're going to try to do something else. I back myself to hit good balls and the best bowlers in the opposition. That's how I motivate myself to play out there. Very happy to get two points. We kind of let it slip away last two games. For us to bounce back like this was very crucial. That was a different mentality and phase altogether (T20 World Cup 2016 semis). I was in a space where I felt I could hit any ball. I back myself to hit good shots. When they come off they look good.",1681567143953,66260
