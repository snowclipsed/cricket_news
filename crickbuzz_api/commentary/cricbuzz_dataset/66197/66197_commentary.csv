preview,"  It’s been 1427 days since Chennai Super Kings have played at their revered AmbuDen. That’s a long time, long enough for the IPL to induct two new teams - one of whom will be their opponents today. Long enough for MS Dhoni to retire from International cricket and retire into a reclusive life, but still command the ability to sell-out stadiums in an instant with fans flocking by for a rare glimpse of their Thala. Long enough that some would have forgotten how much of a fortress Chepauk used to be for CSK - they’ve lost just 15 out of 56 games played at this venue.",1680526798257,66197
preview,"Tickets were sold out days in advance for the 3rd of April, and fans have been thronging the venue since 5pm if reports are to be believed. Even the disappointment of CSK’s opening day defeat can’t dampen the mood, because this team at Chepauk is a different beast. They have the spin attack and top-order to dominate at this venue, and don’t underestimate their 12th man, or should I say 13th man now which is the Chennai crowd.",1680527317438,66197
preview,"The opponents Lucknow Super Giants come into this game after a thumping win over Delhi. Their skipper KL Rahul has a solid record against CSK, and three out of their four overseas picks had a dream debut in that game against Delhi. The Chepauk pitch could also really suit someone like Ravi Bishnoi, who has at least one wicket to his name in his last eight IPL games. Expect a cracking contest, stick around for the toss and team updates….",1680527387445,66197

preview," Expecting a good atmosphere here in Chennai, everyone has been looking forward to this day. (On batting position) In a new franchise, you have the accept the role you have been given and perform as best you can. Every batter would say the higher up you are the better, but I've been given that responsibility to bat at number 4. (On being fit to bowl) Yeah, everything is coming out nicely. I've worked very hard to get to the place that I'm at this moment with my knee, so might be able to turn the arm over tonight. (On Chepauk) I've not played too many games here, so I've tried to understand the easy ways we can bat here and how to bowl. Spin is going to come into the game more here than in Ahmedabad. Who knows what the wicket will give? So we have to adapt and see how we go...",1680527760012,66197
preview,"""Square boundaries - 68m on one side, 61m on the other side, downtown - 75m. The batters will look to scoop and dab. It's got a white sheen and it's got the grass clippings rolled in. Average first innings score is 150, winning score will be around 165-167. Chasing here is challenging, but it's a night game. Will the dew be a bit of a factor? Fingers crossed that it's not too outrageous. Even though it's 'spin to win', if a batter gets in and smashes it to the small sides, then look out, because the bowlers here at Chepauk can absolutely disappear.""",1680528422115,66197
preview,"Injury has kept me out for a long time. Had two injuries at once - stress fracture in the back and a quad tear. Both are serious injuries. Back is the main muscle for a fast bowler. It's taken time but the body is good now. Have been playing a long time now which comes with responsibilities. And I am someone who likes responsibilities. Be it taking wickets, stopping runs and guiding the new bowlers. This is a big platform where you learn after making mistakes.

preview," Does mean a lot to be back here. IPL started in 2008 but we've not played a lot of cricket here. Only about 5-6 seasons we've been here. This is the first time the full stadium will be operational, a few stands were empty earlier. Really glad that we get to play all our home games here at Chepauk, means a lot.

With the spinners, some skid on so if we hit the right lengths batting can be difficult. Very special feeling when I got here earlier.

post," The crowd came in large numbers for CSK's return to Chepauk, and they've got what they wanted. Kyle Mayers had them silenced early on in the chase. It was again an extraordinary display of powerhitting from him, bringing up fifty off just 21 balls and getting LSG off to a flier. But the game turned around as soon as spin was brought on, with Moeen Ali bowling a superb spell, and Santner doing a brilliant job as well. That was just classic CSK in action at their fortress, with Dhoni pulling the right strings. LSG were 73/0 after the first 5 overs. But they had collapsed to 136/5 after 14, with Moeen picking up a wicket in each of his four overs. The turnaround was made all the more sweeter by Deshpande who overcame a poor start with the ball to execute some good plans at the death, getting rid of Nicholas Pooran in the process and putting the final nail in LSG's coffin.",1680545073100,66197

post," Not the ideal start after winning the toss. The first couple of overs it was a bit sticky and there was a bit of movement, but we did not bowl in the right areas and they got that flier. When you have quality batters in the opposition, they make you pay. Something for us to learn but the way Rutu and Conway played was brilliant. It does take time to learn what lengths to bowl on a surface, but to go for 70 odd in six overs isn’t ideal. We batted well but we didn’t capitalize the small momentum. Kyle (Mayers) is coming off good form, he was smoking them for West Indies and comes here with the same form and intent. Great to see what he’s done with the opportunity. Bishnoi is someone I’ve played with for a while, he gets wickets when things aren’t going well, puts his hand up and contains runs. Good to see different guys putting their hands up. Wouldn’t change the toss decision, we didn’t win because we didn’t capitalize the small moments. We had a good start but couldn’t press on. Not often we’ll find 4-5 guys caught on the boundary ropes, they needed to go over and will go over the next time. We’ll take that in T20 cricket, today the game didn’t go our way but this is the way we want to keep playing.",1680545813877,66197

post," It was a pretty good wicket to bat on. Both powerplays looked challenging for the bowlers. Our job was to try and tie it up a little bit through the middle. It's always nice when Moeen takes a couple of wickets. On this wicket, it makes it easier with the boundary dimensions. I'm kinda used to that playing in New Zealand, we tend to play on one side of the block. It's a privilege to play any game, so I try to do my best. The wicket was a bit flatter than I wanted it. The last time we were here, it was spinning every game. Maybe as the tournament goes on, we might play a couple more spinners. It was awesome (to be back), had fond memories back in 2019. Nice to play in front of all these people tonight, they make it pretty loud. Sea of yellow, it's a privilege to play in front of them.",1680545870875,66197

post, Terrific high-scoring game. All of us were thinking how the wicket would be. It was the perfect first game that could happen. I thought it would be much slower. But it was a wicket where you could score runs. I was quite surprised with the wicket. But we'll have to see if we can produce a wicket like this game after game. Fast bowling we need to slightly improve. Need to bowl according to the conditions. WHat is important is to keep an eye as to what the opposition bowlers are doing. One more thing is they'll have to bowl no no-balls or extra wides.  Only reason we've scored those runs is if the surface is nice.,1680546425435,66197

post, They have big hitters. Almost tried to bowl like Test cricket. Tried to spin the ball. The combination was nice (with Santner). The partnership worked well. MS knows what he's doing. He knows when to bowl players. I do believe off-spinners can bowl to right-handers especially bowling to the big leg-side. I'm not going to bowl all the time with Jadeja there.,1680546607626,66197
