0.3," Chahar to Rohit, , Rohit is away. As are MI. Two balls was all he needed to size up Chahar, comes down the track and picks the inswinger on the stumps, Rohit lofts beautifully over extra-cover and timed it well too ",1680962488890
0.6," Chahar to Rohit, , a floaty outswinger outside off, full, Rohit gets forward and slices the loft, clears mid-off though and it runs away ",1680962786514
1.4," Tushar Deshpande to Rohit, , Rohit gets a tad lucky, full outswinger outside off, he gets forward and lofts but the swing takes the thick outside-edge and flies away over backward point, beats third man to his right ",1680963026691
2.1," Magala to Ishan Kishan, , nice. Full and just outside off, Ishan Kishan gets forward and gently caresses it through point, into the gap and runs away ",1680963173435
2.3," Magala to Ishan Kishan, , that's a tad too full and wide outside off, Ishan Kishan unfurls a gorgeous cover drive, on a half-bent knee and wide of mid-off ",1680963239185
2.4," Magala to Ishan Kishan, , cracks it away. On a back of a length on off, not a bad ball but Ishan Kishan has put it away with a pull over mid-wicket ",1680963277756
3.1," Tushar Deshpande to Rohit, , can't bowl there. Short and wide outside off, Rohit slashes and easily clears the short square boundary on the off-side, 62-metre hit ",1680963421709
3.6," Tushar Deshpande to Rohit,  Bowled!! Fantastic delivery and Tushar Deshpande is pumped. That's a cracker. Angled in on a back of a length and Rohit actually played that badly as I see the replay, the bat came down at an angle pointing towards mid-wicket, the ball just held its line and hit middle-stump. A good delivery made better by Rohit's tentativeness. The feet nowhere and the castle is down.  ",1680963621856
4.4,"Santner to Green, , long-off is wide and Green has found enough to beat him to his right. Full and wide outside off, driven in the air and the timing takes it to the fence",1680963844576
5.2," Magala to Ishan Kishan, , bad ball and smashed. A low full-toss outside off, hammered wide of mid-off to his left. MI off to a good start ",1680963999292
5.3," Magala to Ishan Kishan, , Magala is bowling badly here. This is a half-volley on off, Ishan Kishan gets forward and clears his front leg to loft powerfully over mid-on, one bounce over the ropes ",1680964039912
6.4," Jadeja to Ishan Kishan,  Caught by Pretorius!! Ishan Kishan shakes his head as he walks back. He looked to be in strife before this over, has that resulted in his dismissal? A back of a length delivery outside off, he goes for the flat-batted pull but miscues it and finds long-on. Pretorius goes back to reverse-cup with ease.  ",1680964452838
7.2," Santner to Suryakumar Yadav,  Caught by Dhoni!! Another failure for SKY. He was walking off when he saw the ump signal a wide and waited. MS though knew and reviewed it straightaway after his appeal for caught behind is turned down. A nothing delivery down leg, but such is SKY's bad luck at the moment that he has gloved the sweep and MS takes a sharp catch. . MI lose two in two overs.  ",1680964743594
7.5," Santner to Tilak Varma, , good shot even though it was just wide of Rahane at slip. Quicker length delivery across Tilak Varma who steers it in the air and to the left of Rahane who barely had any time to react, the ball flew past his outstretched left hand ",1680964897674
8.2," Jadeja to Green,  Caught&Bowled!! CSK are spinning MI out. Superb catch by Jadeja and ump Gaffaney is ducking for cover. But Jadeja has caught it and rolled the ball to him. Smashed back at him, Jadeja hoists his hands up more in protect mode but the ball sticks in his right-hand and that's the end of Green. He hit it hard but far too close to escape from the clutches of a fielder of Jadeja's ability.  ",1680964992007
9.1," Santner to Arshad Khan,  Lbw!! Plumb. Even if Arshad Khan had reviewed this, he was a dead dodo. Tossed up on middle-stump, pitches in line and Arshad is playing all around his front pad, flicks and misses, rapped on the pads and the ump has the finger up in a flash. No bat even as it is caught at slip by a diving Rahane. More woes for MI.  ",1680965348897
9.4," Santner to Tilak Varma, , flat and a fine shot that, just outside off, Tilak Varma goes on the back foot and opens the face of the bat to place the cut wide of backward point and gets it wide of sweeper cover to his right ",1680965495630
12.5," Jadeja to Tilak Varma, , finally Tilak Varma breaks the shackles. Fired down leg, he goes down on one knee and swings it away to the fine-leg fence, short boundary and easy hit ",1680966229015
12.6," Jadeja to Tilak Varma,  Lbw!! Jadeja ends his spell with a big wicket. Slowed it down after the last ball, on off and middle, Tilak Varma gets forward to flick and plays across the line, misses and is rapped on the pads low. No inside-edge and it is crashing into the top of middle-stump. Varma  even though one can't blame him for taking it considering his side's situation.  ",1680966342148
15.6," Magala to Tristan Stubbs,  Caught by Gaikwad!! Good tag-team work from Pretorius and Gaikwad sees the end of Tristan Stubbs. Tristan Stubbs comes down the track and it's another slower ball off-cutter outside off, he slices the loft, Pretorius slightly misjudged that as he tracked back at long-off, takes it over his head but losing his balance and going outside the cushions, so lobs it up and Gaikwad from long-on is there to take a simple catch. No need for the third ump to check if it was a clean catch.  ",1680967230183
16.3," Tushar Deshpande to Tim David, , this is what Tim David can do. But this is a half-volley outside off, in the slot and slaughtered back over the sightscreen straight down the ground ",1680967396538
16.4," Tushar Deshpande to Tim David, , Senapati the sub from sweeper cover runs to his left and fails to stop it cleanly, the ball rolls away into the cushions. Sloppy. The slower ball off-cutter outside off is short and Tim David cut that hard ",1680967437670
16.5," Tushar Deshpande to Tim David, , now Tim David is cashing in. But this is poor bowling. Full and too much width outside off, allows David to free his arms and lofts it over extra-cover, short boundary and easily over ",1680967479424
16.6," Tushar Deshpande to Tim David,  Caught by Rahane!! Tushar Deshpande has his revenge. It's a big wicket for Tim David was beginning to look dangerous. A slower ball off-cutter outside off, David did not go hard on the pull, was a sort of a half-hearted shot, a flat hit but straight to the fielder at deep mid-wicket. Rahane is as safe as they come, he does not drop that and David is livid as he walks back. Deshpande though is venting out all his frustration as he utters a few curse words.  ",1680967563940
19.1," Pretorius to Hrithik Shokeen, , thick leading-edge and lucky boundary for Hrithik Shokeen and MI. Deceived by the slower ball on middle-stump, Shokeen flicks and the leading-edge clears Magala at short third man ",1680968121913
19.4," Pretorius to Hrithik Shokeen, , now a top-edge clears MSD. The 150 is up for MI. Dug in short and slower outside off, Hrithik Shokeen pulls and the top-edge is handy ",1680968264483
19.5," Pretorius to Hrithik Shokeen, , mid-off is up and Pretorius bowls a low full-toss wide outside off, Hrithik Shokeen gets across and lofts well, one bounce over the ropes ",1680968333604
19.6," Pretorius to Hrithik Shokeen, no run, Hrithik Shokeen reviews and loses. The wide yorker is just wide of the tramline on the off-side but Shokeen has moved too, so the line moves, he fails to dig it out, MS with gloves on threatens to throw down the stumps and prevents the bye.  ",1680968412045
0.4," Behrendorff to Conway,  Bowled!! Chopped on!! The wicket MI needed, Behrendorff is pumped. Conway was looking tentative and this was always on the cards. A bit back of length and seams in late from outside off. Conway tries to cut it towards point but inside edges it onto leg stump. The Kiwi opener walks back without scoring...  ",1680969486053
0.6," Behrendorff to Rahane, leg byes, , length ball that strays in line. Off the hips and trickles away to the fine leg boundary ",1680969621595
2.3," Behrendorff to Rahane, , short on the body, pulled with more conviction and lands beyond fine leg. The benefit of having a short boundary... ",1680970085441
3.1," Arshad Khan to Rahane, , whipped away for a sixer! Woah Rahane. He is in fine rhythm. That was swinging down on to the pads and Rahane lofted it over fine leg for a sixer. Second time he has sent it over the fence. He is timing them so well ",1680970255921
3.2," Arshad Khan to Rahane, , short, wide, gets the treatment it deserved. That was slashed past point for a four. Hung back and smashed it hard ",1680970317498
3.3," Arshad Khan to Rahane, , four more. He is on a roll. Jinks like never before. The brains before brawns now, Was a short of length delivery outside off, Rahane waited on it and guided it past the man at short third for a four. Where have you been hiding, Jinks? ",1680970357767
3.4," Arshad Khan to Rahane, , oh my my! He is tearing into this young guy. Short, wide, Rahane cracks that off the back foot for a four. 31 off 12 for Rahane! Rub your eyes or pinch yourself? He is putting on some show. The local lad is taking MI down ",1680970406784
3.5," Arshad Khan to Rahane, , SRTesque! That's a treat to your hungry eyes. Fuller ball, little back lift, comes down on it and punches the drive past the bowler for a four. 22 off the over. He is making a meal of this over ",1680970452510
4.3," Green to Rahane, , ho ho ho! He has lit up the stadium. The sea of blue not liking this for sure. Was a length delivery on the pads, Rahane dispatches it with elan. Such finesse, such class. Top notch stuff from Rahane ",1680970659585
5.2," Chawla to Rahane, , the midas continues...tossed up ball outside off and Rahane didn't control the drive a lot and the ball came off the outer-half of the bat but got it through the gap for a four. He has moved to 48 off 18 balls ",1680970956336
5.3," Chawla to Rahane, ,  He has been phenomenal today. He has been too hot to handle. Rahane waited on the short ball, went back and smashed the pull past the man at square leg for a four ",1680970991152
7.4," Chawla to Rahane, , the indomitable Rahane continues his good run. Charges down, gets to the pitch of the ball and lofts it off the pads and away from the man at deep mid for a four. He is batting like a dream ",1680971648438
7.6," Chawla to Rahane,  Caught by Suryakumar Yadav!! And that's what MI wanted Chawla to do and he has done it. The danger man is gone. The batter wanted to punch it down the ground but ended up cue-ending to the man at long-on. Simple take for the fielder in the deep. Did the ball hold on to the deck a little? Might well have been the case as Rahane has seldom mistimed anything barring this. The moment he hit it, he knew it. But an excellent knock comes to an end.  ",1680971718320
9.1," Chawla to Shivam Dube, , and that's exactly why Shivam Dube has been sent at 4! Was a tossed up delivery and Shivam Dube got his front foot out of the way to smash it past long-on. Was drilled down the ground ",1680972148339
9.4," Chawla to Gaikwad, , the CSK juggernaut is hard to stop tonight. Lovely timing and placement from Mr. Consistent! Was a tossed up delivery and Gaikwad got forward and silked the drive past cover for a four ",1680972235381
10.4," Green to Shivam Dube, 1 run, pats the length delivery down to long-off for a single. Played that off the front foot sans much feet movement. The ton is up for CSK ",1680972529900
11.4," Hrithik Shokeen to Shivam Dube, , and gets it away past deep mid for a four. Poor delivery by Hrithik Shokeen and Shivam Dube went back to slam the pull. Had to wait a little longer for the shot ",1680972796560
13.1," Hrithik Shokeen to Shivam Dube, , pushed quicker and fuller. In the swinging arc for Shivam Dube and he clears his front leg to give it a big slog over long-on. Six on most grounds, a huge six at the Wankhede! ",1680973127358
13.5," Hrithik Shokeen to Gaikwad, , half tracker on the pads, slapped hard to the right of deep mid-wicket. Ruturaj joins the act... ",1680973254070
14.2," Kartikeya to Shivam Dube,  Bowled!! Dragged on!! A soft dismissal for Shivam Dube. This was a gentle length ball, Dube waits a long time to cut behind square. But just gets an underedge back onto the stumps.   ",1680973363161
14.4," Kartikeya to Gaikwad, , low full toss, slips out the hands and Ruturaj Gaikwad whacks it beyond the deep mid-wicket boundary for six!! ",1680973539319
17.1," Behrendorff to Rayudu, , low full toss, Rayudu nicely places his drive to the right of extra cover and left of long-off. Runs away for four... ",1680974178123

17.3," Behrendorff to Rayudu, 2 runs, full and under the bat. Rayudu lifts it over the bowler's head but long-off cuts it off ",1680974281365
18.1," Arshad Khan to Rayudu, , game, set, match!! An empathic win for CSK at the home of their enemy. This was a nice slot ball outside off, Rayudu swung his willow and gets it wide of long-off. Races away to the fence... ",1680974490443
