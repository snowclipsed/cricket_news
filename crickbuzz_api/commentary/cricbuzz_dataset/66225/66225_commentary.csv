preview," Time for the ‘El Clasico’ of the IPL, but it must be said that so far these two teams haven’t been playing like the Barcelonas or the Real Madrids of the cricketing world. First to the hosts, who were given a good old thrashing by Virat Kohli and Faf du Plessis in the previous game. Their bowling lacks any real bite, and if the news about Jofra Archer’s injury is true it will look even weaker. On the batting front, despite all that star power it has been the uncapped Tilak Varma who impressed in the first game. A lot of questions to answer for the MI Paltan, but maybe a return to the Wankhede could be the right ignition for Rohit and the boys.",1680958743391,66225
preview,"For Chennai Super Kings, opener Ruturaj Gaikwad has been in sublime form, with back-to-back fifties this season but MI have been his bogey team in the IPL, with four single-digit scores in five innings against them. The CSK batting has looked solid with Devon Conway and Moeen Ali also getting amongst the runs, but they’d expect more from their marquee signing Ben Stokes. Bowling is surely the weaker suit for Dhoni’s side, given the inexperience of their death bowlers. They were given a scare by LSG in the last game, but managed to close out the game. Today, traveling away from home could be a little more tricky.",1680959439339,66225

preview," Short leg-side boundary for the right-hander, just 63m and the fine-leg boundary is just 54m. Expect a lot of ramps today. The average score here in 2022 was 167, but teams will be hoping for more than that on a ground with these dimensions. However, if you remember CSK were bowled out here for 97 last year. There is a lot of grass, all the way through but no clear big patches. So the ball might do a little bit but if there’s dew it will slide on to the bat. Hoping for a really good cricket match but just wonder if the new ball will do a bit here, says ",1680960020644,66225
preview," Pretty big match for all those involved, the rivalry goes back a long way. We’ve had some great games in the past and hopefully another good game today. In the second game, our batting was outstanding and with this new impact rule you can strengthen your batting. Rutu got us off to a very good start. Tonight looks like another good wicket so hopefully we can get some runs and defend it. We want to adapt well to the surface, there’s some pretty good bounce here for the seamers but we can try to use that as a spinner as well.",1680960461359,66225

preview," We would have bowled first too. It's a good pitch, always a good pitch to bat. Always something in it for the bowlers. We just have to play good cricket. We have been really well in the last few days, spoke about what went wrong in our last game in Bangalore, hopefully we can get the result tonight. Unfortunately we have got an injury, I would not call it an injury but it is . It is a great feeling to be back at the Wankhede. The crowds have always been loud, look forward to playing in front of our home crowd.",1680961056737,66225

post,"But forget all that. Because today was all about one man. One man who came out of syllabus and ended up smashing the fastest IPL fifty of the season. And he did so with pure cricketing shots, not one slog, not one shot in anger. A loud clarion call from Ajinkya Rahane that he is not yet finished!! Rahane couldn’t stay the course, but he did enough to leave the result to just a mere formality. Shivam Dube came out and played a few big shots, but then chopped one back onto his stumps. Ruturaj stayed till the end, as impact sub Rayudu joined him to finish the game off. A big boost to NRR as well for CSK. Now wait on for the presentations…",1680974575574,66225
post," We lost our way in the middle, did not capitalise on the start we got. It was a good pitch, 30-40 runs short and could not capitalise in the middle overs. Got to credit their spinners, they bowled well and kept us under pressure. You need to try out different things, you need to attack and be brave. We have got a couple of young guys and got to give some time to them. They have real talent and we have to back them and show trust in their ability which we are doing. The senior guys need to step up starting with me. We know the nature of IPL, when the tournament starts we need to get some momentum and when you don't it is tough. Just two games and all is not lost still. If you win, you can win a few on the trot and when you lose it is hard to come out of that momentum. Hopefully things start to change. Things we speak in the changeroom has not worked in the middle. We know we had a very disappointing last season, but we always start afresh, even when we won the 5 trophies, we never thought we won it last year. Every opposition is quality here and we need to be at our best to beat them. These two games has happened, we can't change. Of course we can learn and be more brave in changing things on the field.",1680975209949,66225

post," Really enjoyed it, I got to know before the toss. Moeen was unwell. And Flem told me I was playing. Had a good domestic season. I just try to maintain my shape. Focus on timing. It is all about you have to feel that you are playing a match. IPL is a long tournament and you never know when you get an opportunity. I always enjoy playing at Wankhede. I have never played a Test here. I would want to play a Test here. Important thing about Mahi bhai and Fleming is they give freedom to everyone. Mahi bhai told me to prepare well.",1680975254293,66225

post," Feels good. Not to forget we lost Deepak in the first over. He's our new ball bowler and Magala playing his first match. The good thing is spinners bowled well. It was a bit two-paced after 7 overs, started turning. The spinners and the fast bowlers came back well. Magala was good and so was Pretorius. We believe in him, and when you're new you are under pressure but playing in the IPL for a few years brings different pressure [on Deshpande]. He had a great domestic season, he is improving. He has a lot of potential but he can improve by not bowling those no-balls, and by being more consistent. Me and Jinks spoke at the start of the season and I told him to play to his strengths, use your ability to manipulate the fields. I told him to go and enjoy, don't take stress and we'll back you. He batted well and he was not happy with the way he got out, that says it all. I think every game is important, you look at the problems in front of you and take it one step at a time, not look at the league table for now.",1680975794186,66225

post," When we were bowling, the odd ball was turning. So me and Mitch wanted to bowl in good areas because they have so many powerhitters. Everytime we come here, the wicket plays different - sometimes it is flat, sometimes it is sticky. (On partnership with Santner) We surely discuss, whoever starts advises the other person on what lengths to bowl. We keep talking and advising each other.",1680976159484,66225

post,"That's all for today. A slightly surprising Man of the Match choice, it must be said but can't take anything away from Jadeja's performance as well. He came in after the powerplay and turned the game, but the most memorable moments of today came out of the willow of Ajinkya Rahane. A Mumbai lad through and through, came back to the Wankhede and sunk Mumbai Indians on his CSK debut. Some selection headaches now for the team in yellow.... But that's for another day, for now they can sleep sound knowing they have another win on the board. Hope you guys sleep sound as well, this is  signing off on behalf of  and ",1680976325758,66225
