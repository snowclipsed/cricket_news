preview," Cricket is definitely a religion in India -  we witnessed a prime example of the same at the Narendra Modi Stadium in Ahmedabad yesterday as the 16th season of IPL kicked off. The entire stadium was jam-packed with passionate fans rooting for their respective team, with seas of yellows and blues coming to prominence. A grand opening ceremony was followed by a closely fought encounter between GT and CSK, with the home side, the defending champions, sailing to the finish line in style! The IPL caravan now moves on to the northern part of India where Punjab Kings will be hosting Kolkata Knight Riders in Mohali.",1680338704035,66173
preview," It’s a new dawn for both Punjab Kings and KKR with new captains and new coaches at the helm. New beginnings always provide opportunities to shine and emerge as heroes. Both teams are facing some injury concerns and player availability issue for their opening game. Punjab begin their quest for the IPL trophy under Shikhar Dhawan. Although they haven’t won the IPL till now, they do have a lot of firepower in their side. They bought Sam Curran with a record-breaking bid at the auction and the young man will be certainly striving to impress. Death bowling was an issue for them in the previous edition but Sam Curran can be the ace for them in partnership with Arshdeep Singh.",1680339687819,66173
preview,"Kolkata Knight Riders will be led by Nitish Rana. It was a forced change as Shreyas Iyer got injured during the BGT. It will be a real test for him but he has some exciting players at his disposal. They are a side who rely on all-rounders and they certainly bat deep. Shardul Thakur and Lockie Ferguson were traded in by them pre-season and that definitely adds sharpness to their bowling. In the last season, both Punjab and Kolkata had middling returns and they will be eager to come to the fore with a solid opening game. Will Punjab Kings rule the roost at their home ground? Or will KKR fire on all cylinders today? The toss and team lineups will be out in a while.",1680339819695,66173
preview," ""Average first innings score in afternoon matches here is 159, nine runs less than evening matches. Also, 80 percent matches have been won by teams chasing. A lot of that has to do with the moisture in the surface. However, this pitch is light brown in colour which tells me there's not a lot of moisture. It's also very hard, so it might be more even for teams batting first and chasing. There's a good covering of grass, looks quite even. Dimensions of the ground are unique. If you go to the eastern side, it's the larger of the two boundaries - 72 meters in distance, and also against the wind. That's not where you want to hit. Down the ground is 77 meters. Spinners would want to capitalise on that."" - ",1680340683938,66173

preview," My preparation has been good. I got injured during red-ball season, so I was preparing for white-ball season. We have a new coach and we have a new plan, so let’s hope for the best. (On Sunil Joshi, Punjab Kings spin bowling coach) I have learnt a lot from him. Being a leg-spinner, he advises me to go for wickets.

preview," To be honest, even though it might look small, you still have to get good bat to ball. I still respect every ground that I play in. It's just hitting the ball in the stands as usual. Always been fun playing in India. The environment, and the love from the fans, home and away, is just unbelievable. It is something to cherish and I will do my best in whatever role. (On being a senior player along with Narine) Whenever you think too much, you might get a bit of pressure. So, I try to be as relaxed as possible. In the back of my mind, I know that we've been here for years now and he is more senior than me. I look to make sure to get the job done and do my best all the time. (On their roles) Yeah, we do talk about it but not that much. I know that my part is to finish games, to get the team to a good total whenever batting first. He knows his job is to bowl four overs, get as many wickets as possible and keep bowling tight. My job in the field is to field in the hotspots. So, at the end of the day, we discuss stuff but not too much. He knows his role, I know my role. (On their targets) I won't say it, but I do have my goals when I come to tournaments. I'd like to raise the bar every year. Sometimes it doesn't happen, but I still set the standards and the bar high. So, whenever you achieve it, you contribute to the team too.",1680342111984,66173

post,"That's it the game has been decided by rain and . They win on DLS method. Coming to KKR's chase, it was derailed early on by Arshdeep as Kolkata lost three quick wickets. There was a resurrecting job done by Venkatesh Iyer, who was drafted in as an Impact player and Nitish Rana but the latter fell to Raza and Rinku Singh fell early. At that stage, DreRuss joined Iyer and the duo took the attack to PBKS. But after an expensive over, Sam Curran got the big wicket of Russell and when the rain started appearing, KKR were behind on DLS. Russell's wicket further set them back and despite a couple of sixes, they were behind by 7 on DLS par when play was stopped. Shikhar Dhawan cleverly rotated his spinners to rush through the overs perhaps sensing rain was in the air and the ploy worked. Stick around for the presentations..",1680358790820,66173

post," Was thinking of using Anukul with the ball but didn't find the right situation for it. Russell not bowling at the death wasn't because of any injury issue. I just felt like going with my five main bowlers. They batted well, judged the wicket better than us. Anything could've happened if the rain didn't arrive. Venkatesh got out unfortunately as we were trying to get ahead on DLS. The shot was on. Overall it was a good game. Plenty of learnings from it. It's only the first game of the season.",1680358790830,66173

post," I tried to be unpredictable. The wicket was good for batting so I was mixing it up. (On giving a stare to Anukul Roy after getting his wicket) He was my batch mate in under-19 cricket. He started to hit me straightaway so I wanted to show aggression. He was also showing aggression so my aggression also came out a bit. Players are expecting that I will bowl yorkers so I tried to surprise them a bit by bowling bouncers. There was some rain around so the wicket had become skiddy, so I was using making use of the conditions on offer. I am enjoying myself and the atmosphere in the dressing room is very good. Going ahead, we will try to keep enjoying and keep winning games for our side. (On Shikhar Dhawan) He has created a very good atmosphere amongst us and we are loving it.",1680358790840,66173

post," It's a great feeling to start the tournament with a win, we'll try to take the momentum in the next game and carry that confidence ahead. According to the situation I used those bowlers, good thing we have got plenty of bowlers in the side. I knew Raza was going to be handy against the left-handers, so he gave us three quality overs. Also have experienced bowlers like Sam Curran and Arshdeep in the side. Wanted to be aggressive and at the same time smart. Was trying to hold one end, and if I got out, someone else would do that. They are youngsters and they are learning. We all are living our dream and we should be happy about it. As a leader I make sure the team stays relaxed and in a happy state of mind.",1680358790850,66173
