preview," Hello, hello! It's game 16. Two teams that are yet to taste a win this season will lock horns tonight. While Mumbai picked just 5 wickets from 2 games, Delhi claimed 14 from 3 games so far. As if that wasn't annoying enough, both teams were completely outplayed, which in turn, had a massive toll on their net run rate as well. One positive to look forward to from a game's point of view, however, is that one team will surely get off the mark tonight. And yes, we expect no weather interruptions for the rest of the evening as DC get set to host one of the most successful IPL side over the years, the Mumbai Indians. Ball one in 60...",1681217404786,66243
preview," Will Jofra Archer play tonight? He missed the last game due to a niggle, but early indications are that he might slot back into the XI and will most likely replace Jason Behrendorff. They might also bring in Sandeep Warrier in place of Arshad Khan. That said, a lot depends on the result of the toss and the nature of the surface of course.",1681218163987,66243
preview," Sarfaraz Khan to play? Phil Salt to make his IPL debut? Would they be tempted to give a chance to Yash Dhull? With 3 losses from 3 games, DC are expected to make a few changes tonight. Manish Pandey, Prithvi Shaw (played as a impact sub last game), and Rilee Rossouw seem the most likeliest to make way should the hosts decide to change certain combinations.",1681218469581,66243
preview,"(On having a good time with the bat) If you get a good start in the first match, then your confidence rises going ahead in the tournament. There is only one thing in mind now as how I can help our team to win matches. Last year it was my first season of IPL, I batted well but I couldnâ€™t finish a few matches for the team. This year my goal is to play more impactful knocks. (On scoring around 400 runs last season) Playing for a franchise like Mumbai Indians and scoring runs gives you confidence, the important thing is to be consistent. Our preparation has been good but partnerships are required to post a big total.",1681219474794,66243
preview,"We got a great bunch of guys in the camp, it's a very pleasant weather as you mentioned. I think we all know we need some more runs on the board, our whole performance has not been great at the moment. The guys need to believe in their ability, and I am pretty sure with the right temperament and attitude we can eventually cross the line. Both the teams are under pressure, we haven't got off to a winning start, so tonight is a big pressure game. It's a massive game in front of our home crowd, hopefully we can put up a good performance. It's good to have that camaraderie in the team.",1681219482569,66243

Warner carried on his good form as he kept the scoreboard ticking. DC lost three more quick wickets after that as Chawla bowled brilliantly, outfoxing the batters on a surface which has something in it for the spinners. Axar proved to be the turning point for the hosts as he looked fluent from the word go and scored a blistering fifty. Warner couldn't up the ante as he would have liked.

19.6,"Nortje to Tim David, 2 runs,  Tim David digs this out towards deep mid-off from where the throw comes in. Warner goes for a flat throw, but it's not accurate enough. Porel has to leap and gather the ball. He takes off the bails quickly, but David makes it in with a dive. MI clinch this game on the final ball of the match. Uff! Absolutely exhilarating stuff",1681235295609,66243

post," First win of the season for Mumbai Indians, and this is Delhi Capitals' fourth successive loss of the season. Nothing going right for Warner and his boys. The DC captain has been amongst the runs, but his strike rate has been a cause of concern. And that's a really big concern. Had it not been for Axar Patel's fifty, Delhi Capitals might have finished with a lesser total after having put in to bat first by the visitors. In reply, Rohit and Kishan got Mumbai Indians off to an excellent start, and although they lost some wickets in a cluster during the run chase, the efforts from their top three made sure to take them over the line. David and Green were calm and composed as MI finally got off the mark. And like we have seen before in the history of IPL, Delhi Capitals might be the team that will struggle throughout the season this time around. Stay around for the presentations..",1681235489308,66243

post," You look at the last three IPL games we have witnessed, they have been amazing. Wrong end of it today, but the guys were fantastic. Rohit played a fantastic knock at the top of the order. Nortje is world-class and that's what we expect from him, Mustafiz too. Timmy David was on the wrong side of it, so I tried to keep it at stump-height. I think from the last three games, we've some positives but we shouldn't lost wickets in clumps. Axar should bat in the top four the way he is striking the ball. From the last three games we have played, there are a lot of positives.",1681235832777,66243

post,"Probably expected it (the game) to finish a lot earlier, but happy we ended up on the right side. I didn't wanna cramp (last ball), took the helmet off and I knew there was two there and thankfully it came off. The conversation (when I went to bat) was to hit 2-3 boundaries and thankfully it came off. There was definitely pressure there, but it was so much fun, to get ten an over, I mean it's moments like these are what you wait for, hopefully this (win) will kickstart our campaign. I knew I was gonna make it and the throw was high and I knew when the ball went to Tim's end he (Tim David) was gonna make it with his dive.",1681235955401,66243

post," Winning the game is the most important. We have been working hard from the first game. We had a camp in Mumbai, getting the result (in our favour) feels good. First win is always special. We played a Test match here recently, the pitch looked different. Getting a slow bowler was important on this pitch. The spinners kept us in the game. We needed to bat well to chase the total. I thought everyone put their hand up. We had to make it count for the team. I needed to make use of the powerplay, I knew we had to keep attacking and take our chances. I tried to create a partnership, had a good communication with Tilak. It was important for us to have a good partnership. We have young guys who haven't played IPL before, so it's important to have faith in them. Give them that confidence, and we are trying to have a healthy atmopshere in the dressing room.  Don't need to make drastic changes, that's really important.",1681236419408,66243

post,"That brings an end to yet another close contest of IPL 2023. Mumbai Indians looked in control for the most part of this run chase, but Delhi Capitals somehow managed to pull things back by taking timely wickets. We had contrasting knocks by the skippers of both the teams, and it was Rohit Sharma's inning that proved to be the match-defining knock as compared to his opposite number. Strike rate does play a pivotal role in this format and today's game was a perfect example of the same. Scoring runs and anchoring the innings is over-rated I reckon, but the strike rate does play a massive role. Hope that David Warner learns the lesson soon and Delhi Capitals get off the mark in the points table. For now, this is Nikhil signing off on behalf of Raju, Abhinav, Ramki and Siva. Goodbye and good night folks! We'll be back tomorrow with the live coverage of CSK and RR - two teams that played the final of the inaugural edition of IPL. See you and take care!",1681236815367,66243
