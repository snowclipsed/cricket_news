0.3," Behrendorff to Prithvi Shaw, , the best of timing from Prithvi Shaw. He shows full face of the bat to a full delivery around off and just punch-drives it down the ground with an air of elegance. Cam Green, from mid-on, had no chance... ",1681221702686
1.1," Arshad Khan to Warner, , bam! Fraction short and angled into the body, Warner says thank you and hammers the pull over a leaping mid-wicket to his left ",1681221887413
1.6," Arshad Khan to Prithvi Shaw, , there is no touch-and-go when Prithvi Shaw hits it off the middle of the bat. He presses forward, leans into a flowy drive and the timing takes care of the rest. Blazed away through covers and it races past the diving right hand of the fielder in the deep ",1681222094426
2.5," Green to Warner, , the timing wasn't great but the outfield is blazing quick. Warner slogs the full delivery and ekes it off the thick toe-end past the diving right hand of mid-wicket. No chance for the fielder chasing from mid-on ",1681222310830
2.6," Green to Warner, , and now some width outside off, Warner throws the kitchen sink and slices it off the thick outside half that goes flying down to the third man fence ",1681222347629
3.1," Hrithik Shokeen to Prithvi Shaw, , lovely from Prithvi Shaw. Got an overpitcher outside off, he leant into the drive and ensured he hit the gap between mid-off and extra cover. Superb timing and placement ",1681222425363
3.4," Hrithik Shokeen to Prithvi Shaw,  Caught by Green!! Got him. Prithvi Shaw's sorry season continues, he flattered once again, only to deceive moments later. Perhaps felt the heat after a couple of dots and went for the release shot. He got a hit-me ball but the shot selection wasn't great. Went for the slogsweep after fetching it from middle and leg, mistimed it horribly and offered a dolly of a catch to Cam Green at square leg.  ",1681222527574
4.4," Meredith to Manish Pandey, , don't bother running Manish! A I0$ full pitcher on the stumps, he brings his bottom hand into play and biffs it powerfully down the ground, beats mid-on to his left ",1681222821007
4.5," Meredith to Manish Pandey, , a bit of luck now for Manish Pandey! He looks to abort his bat swing on the cut, but the ball skids on and jumps up to take the bottom edge and run away past keeper's left to the fine leg fence ",1681222856524
5.5," Hrithik Shokeen to Manish Pandey, , Manish Pandey loves spin and he loves tonking it straight. Skates out of his crease, gets closer to the pitch of the delivery and thumps it to the right of long-on ",1681223119497
5.6," Hrithik Shokeen to Manish Pandey, ,  Once again Pandey uses his feet and doesn't get the timing right on the slogsweep, skews it off the thick inside half and to his delight, it falls short of the diving feep mid-wicket fielder to his right. Nehal Wadhera was the fielder there... ",1681223153283
6.5," Chawla to Warner, , one bounce and over the ropes! Half-tracker on the stumps, Warner swivels on the back foot and smacks the pull with great intent over mid-wicket ",1681223373271
7.4," Hrithik Shokeen to Manish Pandey, , inside edge and four! Pandey rushed down the wicket to slog and got a thick inside edge that flew past keeper's left and to the right of the fielder at short fine ",1681223650681
8.3," Chawla to Manish Pandey,  Caught by Behrendorff!! Use of the feet yet again, but it brings about his downfall ultimately. Seemed to have timed it well, but the straight boundaries are almost 75 metres as compared to the shorter square boundaries. Pandey picks out the fielder at long-off to perfection. Chawla tosses it full outside off, Pandey gets too close to the pitch of the ball and slices it off the thick inside half to JB in the deep.  ",1681224050063
9.5," Meredith to Yash Dhull,  Caught by Nehal Wadhera!! The slower ball does the trick and  A I0$ slower short ball dug into the surface, Dhull goes for the pick-up pull and gets more height than distance. Got it to the longer side of the ground and Nehal does extremely well to run across to his left from deep square and complete the catch with an air of assurance.  ",1681224437994
9.6," Meredith to Powell, , the pace is back and Powell gets off the mark with a boundary. He sits back to this I0$ length delivery and opens the bat face at the last possible instant to run the ball fine past the keeper to his right ",1681224538032
10.4," Chawla to Powell,  Lbw!! Lovely googly from Piyush Chawla. Got it to land on a perfect length and beat Powell on the inside edge. It spun enough from a fullish length and went past the prodding blade. The umpire thought long and deep and had given it out. Clearly Powell didn't pick the googly there. The review was more in hope and it was gonna hit the top of leg peg according to technology.  ",1681224774904
11.1," Green to Warner, , One bounce and over the ropes! Full delivery on and around leg-stump, Warner crouches and paddle-sweeps it really fine to the left of fine leg who had absolutely no chance ",1681224962706
11.3," Green to Warner, 1 run,  Warner gets a full ball outside off and he nails it straight to mid-off who shells a relatively ease chance. Chawla, at mid-off, was a tad late on the leap and couldn't gobble it up. To make matters worse, he fumbles on the leap and falls on his chest and fails to gather the ball cleanly. All this while, Warner and Lalit Yadav were stuck at one end as the latter was guilty of ball-watching. Warner was absolutely fuming and he made his disappointment known to his partner..... There was  ",1681225028876
12.3," Chawla to Lalit Yadav,  Bowled!! The leg peg takes walk. The slower, loopy googly from Piyush Chawla. Lured Lalit Yadav into a forward stride and did him in the flight. It snakes past the inside edge to smash the top of leg peg.  And he will be slightly relieved after that dropped chance in the previous over.  ",1681225317373
12.6," Chawla to Warner, , full and right in the slot around leg-stump for David Warner, he stays low and hammers the slog sweep square on the leg-side ",1681225487288
13.5," Tilak Varma to Axar, , Rohit is not happy as that was an ordinary effort from the fielder! Quicker and flatter, pulled away towards wide long-on. The fielder runs to his left, gets his hands to it but makes a mess of it ",1681225687097
14.4," Hrithik Shokeen to Axar, , shot! Tossed up ball around off, Axar goes inside out over wide extra cover for a maximum. Timed that to perfection ",1681225870158
14.5," Hrithik Shokeen to Axar,  Tossed up around off, Axar once again goes for the inside-out loft but gets it towards wide long-off. Sky in the deep comes in a bit, and then has to track back a bit as the ball is flying. Leaps but it evades his outstretched right hand and clears the fence ",1681225906099
15.2," Green to Axar, , Axar is a man in form and he is showing his class! An off-oace ball at 118kph outside off, Axar strokes it through covers for a brilliant boundary ",1681226076037
15.4," Green to Warner, 1 run,  He has been in consistent form and is carrying on. Good length ball, heaved to deep mid-wicket for a run ",1681226150962
15.5," Green to Axar, , cracking shot! Full ball on middle, Axar clears his front leg and smashes it down the ground. Ramandeep tries to stop it to his right, slides but it's in vain ",1681226193455
16.3," Behrendorff to Axar, , shot! Short one and it's the slower ball, Axar pulls it over long-on for a maximum ",1681226539582
16.4,"Behrendorff to Axar, , oh, no!  Lost it due to the lights perhaps? Length ball on middle, Axar powers it towards long-on and shakes his head in disgust, knew he had mistimed it and expected the fielder to gobble it up. SKY, however, tries to take it over his head but has lost it and is hit just above his right eye and to make matters worse, the ball parries behind for a maximum. The physio checks him for a concussion but he seems to be fine. Good to see. But looks like he has gone out to get some treatment....",1681226572679
17.4," Meredith to Axar, , short ball, Axar stands tall and pulls it past the diving short fine fielder for a boundary, played that well ",1681226928518
17.5," Meredith to Axar, , ,  It's his first IPL Fifty! A slot ball, Axar brings his long levers into play and tonks it down the ground for a maximum. Oh, Meredith has overstepped and a FreeHit coming up.. ",1681226993778
18.1," Behrendorff to Axar,  Caught by Arshad Khan!!  He changed the flow of the game with his ball-striking. In the slot, Axar whips it nicely and uppishly towards deep backward square leg. Arshad Khan moves to his left, gets low and takes a good catch.  ",1681227166899
18.3,"Behrendorff to Warner,  Caught by Riley Meredith!! A leg-cutter on leg, Warner swings across the line but gets a big edge behind towards backward point. Meredith runs in a bit, and pouches it safely. ",1681227322492
18.4," Behrendorff to Kuldeep Yadav,  Kuldeep Yadav Run Out!! Brilliant from Wadhera! Top effort and it pays divindends. On a length, tucked towards mid-on. Wadhera runs in from mid-wicket, picks up the ball with his left hand. Shifts the ball to his right hand and hits the bull's eye. Only had one stump to aim at and he succeeded. Kuldeep Yadav was nowhere in the frame.  ",1681227452401
18.6," Behrendorff to Abishek Porel,  Caught by Green!! . Abishek Porel walks down the track trying to upset the bowler. He stays calm and bowls a pacy ball on leg. Abishek Porel tries to go over mid-off but miscues it completely. Green at mid-off backtracks a bit and catches it.  ",1681227572218
19.3," Meredith to Nortje, , Nortje charges down the track and Meredit follows him with an off-cutter. Heaved away past deep midwicket for a boundary ",1681227786083
19.4," Meredith to Nortje,  Bowled!! Full, fast, and accurate! Nortje makes room andtries to open up the off-side. Misses it completely and the leg stump goes for a cartwheel.  ",1681227823897
0.3," Mukesh Kumar to Rohit, , pure timing from Rohit! Full ball on middle and leg, flicked nonchalantly through wide mid-on. The fielder from mid-on gives it a chase but in vain ",1681228867687
0.4," Mukesh Kumar to Rohit, ,  He comes down the track as soon as the ball is delivered, Picked the length very quickly and nails the pull over deep mid-wicket for a 88m six ",1681228911972
0.6," Mukesh Kumar to Rohit, , a freebie and dealt with! A low full-toss outside off, Rohit strokes it past mid-off and the ball rockets to the fence.  ",1681229023343
1.2," Mustafizur to Ishan Kishan, , a full ball around off, Ishan Kishan takes full toll off it as he smashes it for a boundary down the ground ",1681229160367
1.3,"Mustafizur to Ishan Kishan, , back-to back boundaries! Mustafizur overcompensates as he bowls a back of a length ball outside off. There's a bit of room to play with and Kishan runs it past the left side of short third",1681229204967
1.4," Mustafizur to Ishan Kishan, , crunched! Length ball on off, Ishan Kishan blasts it over mid-off for a rocketing boundary. ",1681229245074
2.1," Nortje to Ishan Kishan, , fortune for Ishan Kishan! A good length ball at 146kph around off, Ishan Kishan with minimal foot movement pushes at it and gets an inside edge that runs past the off-stump and beats the dive of the keeper ",1681229443867
2.5," Nortje to Rohit, , delightful! Pitched up ball, swinging in, Rohit plants his frnt foot across and whips it over wide long for a six. All class from the MI skipper ",1681229590272
2.6," Nortje to Rohit, , the pace of Nortje has worked against him in the last two balls! Back of a length ball outside off at 147kph, Rohit goes at it with hard hands and gets it off the outer half of the bat. Past backward point and he gets the desired result ",1681229632247
3.6," Lalit Yadav to Ishan Kishan, ,  Pitches on a length on off and turns away viciously, Kishan is taken aback as he dabs it somehow past the keeper and the ball races to the fence ",1681229884255
4.2," Axar to Rohit, 1 run, to point, 50 up for MI! Coming in with the arm, placed towards backward point for a brisk single ",1681230023019
4.4," Axar to Ishan Kishan, , in the arc for Ishan Kishan and he doesn't miss out. Smashes it through mid-wicket for a boundary. ",1681230080524
4.6," Axar to Rohit, , innovative from Rohit! Full ball from round the wicket on off, Rohit switches his stance and reverse sweep it past short third to get the desired result ",1681230140110
5.6," Lalit Yadav to Rohit, , shot! A short ball outside off, Rohit shuffles a bit and pulls it with aplomb over deep backward square leg. It's checked whether it is a maximum or not and it definitely is ",1681230355846
7.3,"Lalit Yadav to Ishan Kishan,  Ishan Kishan Run Out!! A huge mixup between the two batters, and Kishan is gone! Kishan reacts in the same way he reacted to, when he was run-out due to Virat Kohli, recently in an ODI series. Taps this towards point, and Rohit calls for the single. Kishan wasn't interested in it, but just because it's a senior pro batting alongside him, he goes for the single. He has no other choice, does he? The throw comes in at the bowler's end and Lalit Yadav collects the ball and takes off the bails at his end with the batter no where near the crease. Kishan has to sacrifice his wicket once again. Was an international game last time, it's IPL this time around. Rohit is disappointed with his call and rightly so.. ",1681230746975
8.6," Nortje to Rohit, ,  If you do, this is what you get. Rocks back in the crease, gets into position before than anyone else can and clobbers the pull over deep square leg for a clean six. One of the cleanest strikes of the night. On his verge of scoring a fifty in IPL after a pretty long time. Think it's 24-odd innings since he has got there ",1681231350524
9.3," Kuldeep Yadav to Tilak Varma, , Suryakumar sitting in the dugout likes it, claps and nods his head in appreciation of this shot. Was banged in short by Kuldeep Yadav and Tilak Varma rocks back to pull it towards deep square leg as the ball hits the cushions on the full ",1681231553758
10.3,"Axar to Rohit, leg byes, ,  Was a straighter delivery on middle and leg, and it kept low as well. Rohit got beaten due to the lack of bounce and got rapped on the pads. The ball, however, races away to the fence beyond the keeper after clipping Ro's pads and it's four leg byes instead. Lucky escape for Rohit!",1681231854746
11.1," Kuldeep Yadav to Rohit, 1 run,  A fifty after a really long time. Was on the pads and Rohit works it through the leg-side for a single. No celebration for Rohit whatsoever, because he has achieved bigger feats in life ",1681232022994
11.2," Kuldeep Yadav to Tilak Varma, 1 run, drilled down to long-on by Tilak Varma for a single ",1681232047445
11.4," Kuldeep Yadav to Tilak Varma, ,  Shimmies down the wicket and launches this over long-off with a fabulous lofted drive. Rohit likes it as well, applauds Tilak Varma's strike ",1681232113460
11.6," Kuldeep Yadav to Rohit, ,  On the batter's pads and the MI captain has put this away to the deep square leg boundary nonchalantly ",1681232177240
13.6," Lalit Yadav to Rohit, 1 run,  Stands tall and smashes this to long-off where Pandey stops it by sprinting across to his right. Saves a boundary just in time ",1681232804377
15.1," Mukesh Kumar to Tilak Varma, , full and wide outside off, Tilak Varma makes room and slices this over backward point for four runs. Excellent start for MI to the over, just what the doctor ordered ",1681233270634
15.2," Mukesh Kumar to Tilak Varma, ,  Gets hold of the full pitch ball and swings it over deep mid-wicket for a clean six.  Tilak Varma continues to shine.. ",1681233329238
15.3," Mukesh Kumar to Tilak Varma, ,  Waltzes down the track and spanks this shortish delivery over cover for a flat six. What a talent is Tilak Varma! Mind blowing folks! ",1681233405781
15.5," Mukesh Kumar to Tilak Varma,  Caught by Manish Pandey!! Mukesh Kumar has the last laugh! Tilak Varma departs after playing yet another impressive knock! Was a full length ball by Mukesh Kumar, right in the slot and Tilak Varma slogs it straight to Pandey at deep mid-wicket. He's not going to miss out on those and Delhi get a much needed breakthrough. This partnership was absolutely taking this game away from them.  ",1681233565698
15.6," Mukesh Kumar to Suryakumar Yadav,  Caught by Kuldeep Yadav!! Got out for a golden duck thrice in a row in ODIs not so long time ago, and he departs for yet another golden duck. Life is tough sometimes. Was a short ball on leg and SKY flicks it straight to the fielder at fine leg. Not one of the best fleiders, but Kuldeep manages to latch on to the catch.  ",1681233640791
16.1," Mustafizur to Rohit, , Rohit is still out there. No need to panic! Was on the pads and Rohit flicks it through square leg with impeccable timing to beat the fielder stationed in the deep, much needed boundary for MI ",1681233774475
16.5,"Mustafizur to Rohit,  Caught by Abishek Porel!! What a big moment in the game! Full and wide outside off, almost a yorker. Rohit tries to guide this towards third man, but he gets a thick outside edge. Flies towards the right side of the keeper and Porel dives to his right as he takes a brilliant one handed catch. Two set batters are back to the pavilion, with two new batters at the crease. This is  as Rohit walks back to the pavilion looking at the heavens in disappointment. ",1681233929097
16.6," Mustafizur to Green, , short of a length outside off and Green opens his account with an exquisite square cut,  ",1681234185792
17.4," Nortje to Tim David, 1 run, full toss on middle and leg, Tim David flicks it through the leg-side for a single ",1681234374745
18.4," Mustafizur to Green, ,  On a length around middle, Green picks the bones out of it and smokes it over deep mid-wicket as the ball clears the boundary, the fielder near the fence is a mere spectator folks ",1681234674583
18.6,"Mustafizur to Tim David, ,  Gets into position quickly and dispatches this back of a length delivery over long-on for half-a-dozen. Mumbai Indians need only 5 runs off the final over. Rinku Singh hit 5 maximums in the last over a couple of days ago against GT, so scoring 5 runs in an over shouldn't be that challenging a task I guess..",1681234752926
19.2," Nortje to Tim David, no run,  Tim David whips this hard to the man at mid-wicket, but Mukesh fails to rise up to the occasion. Succumbs under pressure and puts it down. David's still alive, he's still out there ",1681234923261
19.3," Nortje to Tim David, no run, and that's a fantastic review by DC. Was a yorker length ball that flicked Tim David's bat on its way to the keeper. Hence the onfield call has to be overturned ",1681235057147
19.5," Nortje to Green, 1 run, Was a superb yorker on leg, and Green flicks it to mid-wicket for a single. The throw at the bowler's end was an accurate one, but Nortje failed to gather it. And MI manage to sneak in with a single ",1681235146302
