1.4," Avesh Khan to Kohli, , 130.8kph, authoritative stroke! Short of a good length delivery wide of off, Kohli makes room and hits it on the rise. Slapped over extra cover. Came right off the meat of the bat ",1681135656753
2.6," Krunal Pandya to du Plessis, , , top shot from the skipper! It was a touch too full from Krunal Pandya, du Plessis moved leg-side, got under it and swung it uppishly to the right of mid-on. No chance for the fielder to stop it ",1681135940753
3.1," Avesh Khan to Kohli, , middled it! , short of a good length ball just outside off, Kohli stands tall and drives on the rise. Crisp shot sent through extra cover. No need to run for that! ",1681136008564
3.3," Avesh Khan to Kohli, , 137.6kph, pitched up outside off, Kohli leans across and plays a lovely drive. Got forward and caressed it through extra cover. There was deep cover in place but he couldn't cut it off as the timing was exquisite ",1681136092085
4.3," Krunal Pandya to Kohli, , , wow! Trifle short, not a half-tracker, Kohli goes back in his crease, stands tall and biffs it over long-on for a maximum. That's a very tough shot to play but he managed to generate the necessary power ",1681136317140
5.2," Mark Wood to Kohli, , that's a superb shot! , very full delivery, Kohli backs away, exposes all his stumps but he gets under the ball and thumps it over the bowler's head. Shot! ",1681136529404
5.3,"Mark Wood to Kohli, , even better! Those wrists, I tell you! Stays in his crease, waits for this short of length ball and whip-pulls it nonchalantly over deep mid-wicket. Stand and deliver stuff! LSG and Wood under the pump! ",1681136572157
8.5," Ravi Bishnoi to Kohli, 1 run, 98.6kph, shorter in length, Kohli goes hard on the drive. A single to long-on and that brings up  ",1681137503306
9.2," Krunal Pandya to Kohli, , , Kohli breaks the shackles. Slightly short and the veteran pounces. Slightly crouches and hammers the pull over deep mid-wicket for an 84m six ",1681137651964
9.4," Krunal Pandya to du Plessis, , 89.5kph, slow through the air, du Plessis waits and swings over mid-wicket. Not quite off the middle but he's hit it in the gap. Got low and went hard against this fullish ball ",1681137745308
10.2," Ravi Bishnoi to du Plessis, , , too much width on offer. Faf du Plessis waits on the back foot and scythes fiercely through point. Speeds away to the fence ",1681137914254
11.3,"Mishra to Kohli,  Caught by Stoinis!!  85.1kph, shortish ball, was there to be hit and Kohli chose the right shot. Went for the pull but couldn't get the execution right. Hit it flat and straight down deep mid-wicket's throat! Stoinis crouched low to gobble it up. LSG finally have the breakthrough. The dangerous Kohli is gone. ",1681138209005

12.4," Mark Wood to du Plessis, leg byes, , , pad-lined length ball, du Plessis shuffles and misses the glance. Brushes the batter's pad and eludes the diving keeper to his left ",1681138664918
13.3," Mishra to Maxwell, , slower off the deck but faster after it hit the willow. Was slightly shortish, Maxwell backed away and slashed it over cover for a four. Was muscled ",1681138890116
13.4,"Mishra to Maxwell, , and six more. That was MAXImum power from Maxi. Dropped short by Mishra and Maxwell backed away a little to power it over long-on. Little short and that was it for Maxwell to hammer it",1681138914376
14.3," Ravi Bishnoi to du Plessis, , flat, six! That was flatter outside off and du Plessis stays back and slaps it past long-off for a sixer. Was another muscular hit. Got the room and flayed it away ",1681139183058
14.4,"Ravi Bishnoi to du Plessis, , my my! That ball has gone on a journey. One way ticket for that ball. Was dropped short, du Plessis hung back and slammed it for a  Massive is an understatement. One of his longest sixes ever in IPL",1681139215371
14.6," Ravi Bishnoi to Maxwell, , in the slot? Do I need to say/write more? That's been bashed over the bowler for a sixer. He took the skin off the ball. Another monsterous hit. We dive into a little break... ",1681139322777
15.1," Mark Wood to du Plessis, , maintains his shape, gets under the ball and lofts it over long-off.  Just backed away a little and powered it. The last few balls he has woken up and how ",1681139618562
15.5,"Mark Wood to Maxwell, 1 run,  and Maxwell can just inner-half the slog down to deep mid for a single. Angled the ball in and Maxwell backed away to flay it down on to the on-side but failed to connect properly",1681139827551
16.1," Avesh Khan to Maxwell, , fuller length delivery at 134.8 kph and Maxwell backed away and biffed it over deep mid. That sailed over the fence. Was a length delivery and you don't do that at this stage ",1681139992418
16.5," Avesh Khan to Maxwell, , wristy Maxi! Was a low full toss, Maxwell decides to traverse through the off-side and slices the ball over cover. Some wonderful bottom hand power ensuring he got enough connection on it. Change of bat for him ",1681140200053
17.2," Unadkat to Maxwell, , that's a cue-ender which has raced away fine for a four. Low full toss, outside off, Maxwell backs away but lays some bat on it and the ball goes off the bottom-end for a four. The man at third man was beaten to his left ",1681140437773
17.3," Unadkat to Maxwell, 1 run, Maxi sliced a fuller ball, the man at deep third ran to his right but overran it a little. That meant he was never balance when he got hands to it. That forced the drop. Would it be a costly drop? ",1681140489325
17.4," Unadkat to du Plessis, , and some salt, add some black pepper as well into the wounds of Unadkat. Length and disappaears over deep mid. Got under it and whacked it. He is hitting them huge ",1681140539602
17.5,"Unadkat to du Plessis, , why do we have boundaries? That slipped out of the hands of the bowler and du Plessis thumped the pull over deep square. That sailed over well over the fence. Faf reviewed for an above-waist no-ball. The third umpire had a look at the height of the ball and has deemed it legitimate to Unadkat's respite. Was a dipping full toss and well below the waist. ",1681140590787
17.6," Unadkat to du Plessis, , Faf ends it with a four. The agony and ignominy for Unadkat ends. Was a widish full toss, du Plessis slices it over backward point for a four. RCB racing towards 200 ",1681140735809
18.1,"Avesh Khan to Maxwell, ,  with this sixer. Fuller ball, Maxwell hangs back and biffs that down the ground for a sixer. Superb hitting indeed. Sat deep and allowed the ball to land before smoking it",1681140825242
18.2," Avesh Khan to Maxwell, , wow! Well, we are entertained for sure. That was short, outside off, Maxwell waited on it and just opened the bat face to send it over deep cover. Only relied on timing to send it over the fence. He has changed the pace of the game ever since he has arrived in the middle ",1681140877876
18.3," Avesh Khan to Maxwell, 1 run,  It has taken them just more than 7 overs. These two are in a hurry. Was a fuller ball, Maxwell stayed deep and drove it down to long-on for a single ",1681140952176
18.4," Avesh Khan to du Plessis,  Fuller ball, outside off, du Plessis kneels down and slices the drive past cover for a four. He again didn't lose his shape while connecting ",1681140997544
19.3," Mark Wood to Maxwell, no run, was banged in short, quick, Maxwell backed away to slash it but missed. LSG had two reviews remaining and took the review only to lose it. That sped past the helmet of the batter ",1681141418397
19.4," Mark Wood to Maxwell, , angles in a short ball and Maxwell slams the pull over fine leg. He saw it till the last moment and timed it so well. That flew over fine leg. Another huge hit ",1681141487464
19.5," Mark Wood to Maxwell,  Bowled!! Wood thuds into the woodwork. That was full, quick, Maxwell looks to slog and misses to be clean bowled. That was very quick from Wood again and Maxwell failed to get bat on it this time. The ball angled in a little and that did it for Wood and LSG. End of a superb innings from Maxi. He is the player who can do this and exactly why this team management backs him.  ",1681141540750
0.3," Siraj to Mayers,  Bowled!! Chops it on! That's another delivery which slanted away, Mayers was hanging back sans much feet, The lazy poke only manages to drag the ball on to the sticks. Siraj is off to a flier and so are RCB. Mayers was worried about the ball decking in but this time it didn't. He never moved from his crease and that plotted his downfall. Huge strike for RCB.  ",1681142715559
0.6," Siraj to Hooda, leg byes, , walks across his sticks, looks to tuck it and the ball speeds away off the pads for four leg-byes. That shaped in from a length and angled in as well ",1681142891495
1.2," Willey to Rahul, 1 run, a direct hit at the bowler's end and Rahul was a goner! Was a length delivery, angled in, tucked down little wide of mid-wicket but Maxwell got there to his right and released the throw at the bowler's end ",1681143035420
2.1," Siraj to Rahul, , big effort from Harshal with a dive but failed to stop the four. His body was touching the fence and at the same time he pushed the ball away. The third umpire had one look before he signalled it as a four. That was angled in from a length and Rahul tucked that off the pads for the man at fine leg to give it a chase but in vain ",1681143328296
3.3," Parnell to Hooda, , length delivery on the pads, Hooda whips that easily off his pads and sends it wide of deep square for a four. Such a lovely shot from the right-hander ",1681143692412
3.4,"Parnell to Hooda,  Caught by Karthik!! Length delivery, nipped away, Hooda looked to push it away on the off-side and got an edge on it. It seemed as if it died on the keeper. But the third umpire clarified that it carried easily as DK dived forward to take it. Second one down for LSG. That was a slower ball as Parnell ran his fingers over the ball and Hooda had a lazy waft outside off. The ball hence took its time reaching the keeper and almost dipping on him as that was a slower one. ",1681143816955
3.6,"Parnell to Krunal Pandya,  Caught by Karthik!! Parnell is casting a spell! LSG are three down. Krunal was the Man of the Match in the last game. Didn't get a wicket today and he is out for a duck now. Better example of cricket levelling it out? That was a length delivery, nipped away ever so slightly and Krunal Pandya pushed at it to edge it to the keeper. Lovely length delivery and Krunal Pandya fell prey to it. RCB all over LSG now! ",1681143970265
4.5," Willey to Stoinis, 2 runs, and Siraj drops a tough chance! He ran to take it but failed to get there completely as he had to dive at the end. That was banged in short, Stoinis went for the pull and got a top-edge. The man from mid-on ran towards it but failed to grab it ",1681144246090
4.6," Willey to Stoinis, , and that's serene! Just a checked push drive on the up and sped away beating the infield on the off-side. Was a length delivery angled across and Stoinis just relied on timing ",1681144284166
5.6," Parnell to Stoinis, , was it gloved? That was banged in short at the ribs, Stoinis went for the pull and managed to send it fine past the dive of the fielder at short fine for a four. The fielder dived but the ball escaped his clutches ",1681144550800
7.1," Harshal Patel to Stoinis, , welcomed with a six!! This was too full on the pads, sits up nicely for Stoinis to nonchalantly flick over deep square into the stands... ",1681144882968
7.2," Harshal Patel to Stoinis, , full and wide, Stoinis has a slash and it takes a thick edge over backward point and into the fence...LSG have set their eyes on this over and this bowler!! ",1681144925185
7.3," Harshal Patel to Stoinis, , slower delivery, ends as a low full toss and smoked straight down the ground. Long-off wasn't too wide but such was the power in that shot!! ",1681144962277
8.1," Karn Sharma to Stoinis, , another bowler starts off with a six!! This was a real half-tracker from Sharma. Stoinis rocks back and smokes his pull over deep mid-wicket ",1681145204253
8.2," Karn Sharma to Stoinis, , six followed by a four!! This was tossed up, Stoinis made some room and lifts his drive over the bowler's head for a straight boundary ",1681145243876
8.6," Karn Sharma to Stoinis, , flat outside off, Stoinis slashes it through point. Shahbaz chases after it from deep extra and slightly overruns it. His legs are touching the ropes as he slides onto the ball, four given! ",1681145415586
9.3," Shahbaz Ahmed to Stoinis, , pitched up and quick on off, Stoinis gets under it and hoists his drive over long-off. Goes a long way into the stands for six. That's 50 for Marcus Stoinis ",1681145666844
9.6," Shahbaz Ahmed to Stoinis, , another one!! This is poor from Shahbaz. Fired into the pads and all Stoinis had to do was get in line and flick it over deep square leg. Shahbaz provided all the pace for that shot! ",1681145770886
10.2," Karn Sharma to Stoinis, , tossed up outside off, you don't want to be bowling there!! Marcus Stoinis has a clear golf swing over long-off for a biggie. That would have been the perfect tee if he was on a golf course. ",1681145896814
10.4," Karn Sharma to Stoinis,  Gone! That's the wicket they wanted. This was tossed up but goes wider, Stoinis goes chasing for the big slog but slices it slightly. Not the ideal timing and holes out to Shahbaz at deep extra cover. End of a battling knock, a knock that potentially has got LSG back into the contest. Over to KL and Nicky P now.  ",1681145974109
10.6," Karn Sharma to Pooran, , fuller from Karn Sharma and it was quicker. Pooran takes it on with a big leg side slog. Didn't come off the middle but enough to go over long-on and into the stands on this small ground... Nicky P off the mark with a six! ",1681146089301
11.1," Siraj to Rahul,  Caught by Kohli!! Siraj strikes first ball. He got Mayers in his first over and now it's his opening partner. This was full on the pads, Rahul gave it a flick but didn't have the timing on it. Down the throat of deep square leg where Kohli is pumped to take the catch. He knows the importance of this wicket.  ",1681146187411
11.2," Siraj to Ayush Badoni, , hard length just outside off. Badoni ain't holding back as he slaps it over mid-off. Didn't come off the middle and slightly sliced, but it goes over the infield and towards the boundary... ",1681146316917
11.6," Siraj to Pooran, , good length with some width, a classic square cut from Pooran and that races away to the fence!  ",1681146520018
12.2," Karn Sharma to Ayush Badoni, , wow, how sweet was the timing on that? A fraction short on middle, Badoni goes back and clips it between deep backward square leg and deep mid-wicket. Faf isn't happy with the positioning of the deep backward square leg fielder ",1681146629274
12.4," Karn Sharma to Pooran, , nope, you can't bowl there Mister Karn. This was fired full on leg, Pooran with a very easy flick over deep square leg for six. Didn't even stretch all the muscles to get that beyond the ropes... ",1681146693255
12.5," Karn Sharma to Pooran, , another one!! And this is a superb shot. Googly that is well outside off, Pooran chases it and slaps it over deep extra for a maximum. ",1681146735498
13.1," Harshal Patel to Pooran, , hits the deck hard on a length but straying down leg. Pooran shuffles it and gets some bat on the swing. Over fine leg and just over the ropes as well. Gets the full monty! ",1681146850993
13.5," Harshal Patel to Pooran, , hard length with some width, Pooran tried to cut it away and gets an edge that takes the ball much finer. To the right of short third and for four... ",1681146995794
13.6," Harshal Patel to Pooran, , What a shot!! This was the surprise bouncer, took Pooran a bit by surprise as well but he adjusted well enough to play the pull. Was off balance but managed to time it over deep backward square leg for a flat six!!  ",1681147035175
14.1," Parnell to Ayush Badoni, 1 run, short outside off, Badoni shuffled closer to dab it towards third-man ",1681147125966
14.2," Parnell to Pooran, , another super strike!! This was full on off, Pooran shuffled in to slog. Calculated hit as he smacks it towards the deep square direction where there is no fielder... ",1681147173376
14.5," Parnell to Pooran, , smoked! And that's why he's the 16 crore man. Half volley on middle, Pooran gets under and absolutely whacks it over long-on. Deep into the stands, was deep into any stand in any stadium in any part of the world.  ",1681147283146
14.6," Parnell to Pooran, , Parnell is undoing all his powerplay good work now!! This was a length ball with width, Pooran shuffles closer to cut it square of the wicket. Once again the pace at which he strikes them allows the ball to go for four in a jiffy... ",1681147366069
15.2," Willey to Ayush Badoni, , wide yorker, not too much wrong but Badoni chases it for a big slog. Falls over as he gets a flying edge over short third for a boundary... ",1681147504069
15.6," Willey to Pooran, , bad ball and punished!! This was a slot ball angling onto leg, Pooran waits for the ball to arrive and flicks it over square leg. What an innings Nicholas Pooran is playing, top class! ",1681147698748
16.5," Siraj to Ayush Badoni, , bouncer, goes over the head of the diminutive Badoni and called wide.  ",1681148049932
16.6," Siraj to Pooran,  Caught by Shahbaz Ahmed!! A twist in the tale? And RCB strike with probably their poorest ball of the evening. It was a feeble thigh high full toss from Siraj. Nicky P has been nonchalantly flicking them all evening for six, but this time holes out to deep backward square leg. The stadium is cheering again, game on!!  ",1681148348767
17.2,"Harshal Patel to Unadkat, , oops, unlucky!! Harshal Patel nails the yorker but Unadkat just got his bat down. And to make matters worse the ball caught the edge and runs down to the third-man boundary. The fielder was inside the circle and the ball went very fine",1681148511518
18.1," Parnell to Ayush Badoni, , full and very wide outside off. Stays wide despite Badoni's shuffle inwards ",1681148800664
18.1," Parnell to Ayush Badoni, , oops, action replay!! Badoni shuffled in and Parnell pushed it further wider. Umpire calls him once again... ",1681148814504
18.3," Parnell to Ayush Badoni, , smacked away!! This was short and angling outside off. Badoni sticks to his off side shuffle and then flat bats his pull towards cow corner!! ",1681148933167
18.4,"Parnell to Ayush Badoni,  Hit Wkt!! Wow, what an unexpected turn of events. This was full on leg, Badoni shuffled in and got a ramp on it to take the ball over fine leg. If that was six, the game was pretty much over, the ball did go over the ropes but then Badoni dragged his bat back onto his stumps. Wicket and it's the last known batter's wicket!! ",1681148979583
19.2," Harshal Patel to Mark Wood,  Bowled!! The crowd erupts. 100th IPL wicket for Harshal Patel and couldn't have come at a better time. This was an attempted yorker, ends as a low full toss and Mark Wood swings for the hills and misses. Loses the furniture behind him. Game is not over till it is over...  ",1681149239917
19.5," Harshal Patel to Unadkat,  Caught by du Plessis at long-on!! Oh dear Jaydev Unadkat what have you done? This was banged in short on off, Unadkat could have hit it anywhere but manages it slap it towards an onrushing Faf du Plessis from long-on. He was one of the three fielders kept deep, and Unadkat manages to hole out.  ",1681149522163
