There was a bit of variable bounce. The balls were keeping low from a back of a length. It's drier than the other night. Bishnoi and Krunal bowled extremely well in the first few overs. They kept us back after an electric powerplay. We have to be really good with our lengths and hopefully we can continue to hit the top of the stumps.

post," What a thriller!! No target is safe at the Chinnaswamy and RCB have felt their bowling curse come back to haunt them again. This game had everything, a vintage Virat Kohli knock in the powerplay, a 115m six from Faf, Glenn Maxwell's return to form. And that's just the first innings... In the chase, LSG lost Mayers for a duck, as Siraj cleaned him up with a superb ball in the first over. Deepak Hooda and Krunal Pandya also fell cheaply, as debutant Wayne Parnell was making merry. LSG were struggling at the end of the powerplay, and it needed some big boy power from Marcus Stoinis to get them back in the contest. The big Aussie took on Harshal Patel and Karn Sharma, scoring big sixes down the ground as he notched his first fifty of the season. Still, the game was in the balance. Stoinis got out, and then KL Rahul departed as well. But out walked 16 crore man Nicholas Pooran and showed the world why so many teams tend to break the bank for him! He smoked seven sixes and four fours in his innings, hitting virtually anything on his pads to get the fastest fifty of this season (15 balls). Pooran couldn't stay the course, but Ayush Badoni filled in and scored a big shots. He'd have pretty much surely won the game with a ramped six over fine leg in the penultimate over, but he dragged his bat back onto the stumps and was hit-wicket. The hosts kept the fight on, getting two of their tailenders out cheaply.  But instead it was a last ball finish where DK fumbled and LSG scampered for the bye.... Ah IPL, the gift that keeps on giving!",1681149825668,66239

post,"Disappointed. They played well through the middle. One ball one run. We backed ourselves to get a run-out. Just looking at the wicket, from 7-14 it was quite slower. The last five overs it started skidding on. Really good for some good cricketing shots. Stoinis and Pooran played everything off the middle. They took on one of our main bowler (Harshal) in his first couple of overs. It is a difficult place to bowl at the death. You have to be on top of your game. I was struggling for most part of my innings. Was happy to give strike back to Kohli, sometimes you have to scratch. When I started hitting a few of the middle I got my flow back.",1681150250921,66239

We had to go hard and the ball swung early, and they got 2-3 wickets to put the pressure on us. The only reason we got two points today is for the way the lower order batted. Not ideal for me, I want to score more runs and get the strike rate up as well. We've played on two tough Lucknow wickets, and today we lost 3 wickets so I went slower. I wanted to stay till the end and play with Nicky. Batting 5 ,6, 7 is the toughest positions to play and that's where games are won and lost.
