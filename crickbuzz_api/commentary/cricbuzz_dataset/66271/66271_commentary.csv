preview," Back at the Wankhede Stadium today for the afternoon game, as Mumbai Indians take on Kolkata Knight Riders. Mumbai Indians have won the IPL a record five times, but look a shadow of that championship winning side that they were three years ago. It is really unfortunate for them that the worst lean patch of Suryakumar Yadavâ€™s career has coincided with the IPL. Their big money players Ishan Kishan, Cam Green and Jofra Archer are yet to light up the IPL. However, the good news is skipper Rohit got some runs under his belt last time around, and a win, albeit a last ball scrappy win against DC in their previous game could be the shot of confidence they need for the season.",1681635228756,66271
preview,"Visitors KKR head into this game after a loss at home against SRH, but it was a defeat  where they kept fighting till the end. What has been really refreshing for the Knight Riders has been the performance of their Indian core, with Jagadeeshan getting some runs in the previous game while Nitish Rana and Rinku Singh notched solid fifties. If only their overseas players start pulling their weight, especially Lockie Ferguson with the ball and Andre Russell with the bat. Maybe today is the day they justify their hefty price tags.",1681635268781,66271
preview,"These two sides have one of the most skewed head-to-head records, with Mumbai winning 22 out of the 31 games played between them. However, on form this should be a much closer contest. KKR would be keen to try and balance out the scales once again with a good performance today. It is also a really hot and sultry afternoon in Mumbai, so it is not going to be easy for the players...",1681635858952,66271
preview," byB1$ Wankhede is always a lovely place to be. This is a day game and the sun is beaming down. Last game we got an average score of about 180 at the Wankhede, so we are hoping for a high scoring game but this surface is a very interesting one. There isn't a lot of grass and some of the cracks are showing. It is still a hard surface but because the grass has been shaven so closely, this surface could grip with so many spinners on show for KKR and 1-2 for Mumbai Indians. It could also hold a bit to encourage the slower bowlers. The fast men need to work a bit harder today. In this format, we usually hope for bat to dominate ball but a little bit of help for the slower bowlers isn't too bad.",1681636109439,66271
preview," We had a good game (against SRH) as we scored 200, so as a batting unit everyone is pumped up and confident. It's a big away game for us today. Just training and travelling, plenty of travel days. I am trying to get the most out of this trip. This year has started well for me, I have enjoyed my cricket a lot. Really happy with where I am at, the hundreds have been great, form is good, hopefully I get a game soon. Got great memories at this ground, during the World Cup, and when Delhi (Capitals) came here, we beat Mumbai. It's an incredible ground and an incredible city, so pretty excited. He (Rinku Singh) is a pocket rocket, I didn't see that coming. He smacks it in the nets, and is a serious talent.",1681636109449,66271

preview," We were going to bat first anyways. The mood in the dressing room is good, need to improve our bowling. We believe we can chase 200-210. The ball might turn in the second innings I think. One player can't win you a tournament, it's a team sport. It's good for us, that everyone is scoring runs. We'll target to score around 180 on this wicket, we are playing with the same team..",1681637500971,66271

After sitting out while fielding due to a stomach bug, Rohit came on to bat as the impact player and smashed it around for the first couple of overs. Ishan Kishan also was in a free scoring mood today, as the duo eked out 16 runs off Shardul's first over, 17 off Umesh's second over and then 22 off Narine's first over. MI had the game pretty much settled within the powerplay, as they hurried away to 72 runs. Ishan Kishan found some form again as he smashed a quickfire fifty, before Chakravarthy knocked him over. But out walked Tilak Varma, and he alongside stand-in skipper Suryakumar Yadav quelled any hopes of a KKR fightback. Surya found his form again, and played a few trademark pick-up shots over square leg to the crowd's delight.

post,"  We had a chat in the dugout, we just had to carry the momentum from the previous game and the boys put on a show. I would have loved to finish the game but very happy with how things went. In the afternoon, I thought the wicket was a bit dry but the way the guys batted, it settled down in the evening. At Wankhede, 180-190 is quite chaseable and Ishan took us off to a great start. (On his form) I relaxed and had an easy walk to the wicket, took my time for the first 6-7 balls. And then I thought if I get my eye in I can take it forward. Absolutely, we just need to bat smart in the first 7-10 overs and later on we know what kind of firepower we have. We just did the same thing today and hopefully we carry it forward into the next few games.

post,"  We had a chat in the dugout, we just had to carry the momentum from the previous game and the boys put on a show. I would have loved to finish the game but very happy with how things went. In the afternoon, I thought the wicket was a bit dry but the way the guys batted, it settled down in the evening. At Wankhede, 180-190 is quite chaseable and Ishan took us off to a great start. (On his form) I relaxed and had an easy walk to the wicket, took my time for the first 6-7 balls. And then I thought if I get my eye in I can take it forward. Absolutely, we just need to bat smart in the first 7-10 overs and later on we know what kind of firepower we have. We just did the same thing today and hopefully we carry it forward into the next few games.

post," Would have been happier if we would've finished on the winning side but happy with my performance. They've shown faith in me and it was a very beautiful wicket to bat on. Once you've scored those 30-40 runs, it's just about how you continue. Both of their new ball bowlers were swing bowlers and when you allow swing bowlers to settle down, it can be a problem. So I used my feet, went deep in the crease. After the ball stops swinging it's about how you manoeuvre. I keep getting hit in every game here and there. The thought about going out came but my coach and players urged me to keep going. I think we fell 15-20 runs short. But given how MI were going, they would've chased it down in the next over anyways. But their death bowling was very nice. If we look at their last three-four overs, they didn't give away too many runs. Credit to them.",1681653031923,66271
