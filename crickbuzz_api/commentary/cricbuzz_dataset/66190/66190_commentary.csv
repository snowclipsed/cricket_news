preview," Hello and a warm welcome to the second game of todays double header where Royal Challengers Bangalore will play hosts to Mumbai Indians at the M Chinnaswamy Stadium. The fans have eagerly missed IPL action in Bengaluru since before the pandemic and this season expect a huge sea of red amongst the crowd chanting RCB, RCB, at the top of their voices. RCB have had quite a consistent run in the IPL in the last three seasons, reaching the playoffs every single time. On the other hand, MI struggled last year after the mega auction as they finished at the bottom of the table.",1680439581259,66190
preview,"Now, let’s analyse the strengths and weaknesses of both these sides. To start with, both teams have injury concerns and are missing a few key players. RCB will miss Hazlewood, Hasaranga, and Patidar. Hazlewood and Patidar are recovering from injuries while Hasaranga is on national duty. Mumbai Indians have to do without Jasprit Bumrah and Jhye Richardson. RCB are top-heavy and rely a lot on Kohli and du Plessis. The addition of Bracewell though does give them a good all-round option. They do have good variety in their pace attack but they would strive to be more economical.",1680439618151,66190
preview,"MI signed Cameron Green and that does solidify them. The fact that Archer is fully fit, MI would want him to rise to the occasion. Rohit Sharma has been a bit off-colour with the bat in the last few seasons of the IPL and MI would want him to lead from the front. Their bowling does look a bit short on experience but it also presents an opportunity for new stars to emerge. The bright thing for the visitors is that they have a terrific record at this venue – with 10 wins and only three losses. Will MI once again shine in Bengaluru? Or will RCB put up a clinical display in front of their home crowd? Expect a run-feast as the boundaries are short and the pitch can well be a belter. Toss and team lineups will come out in a while..",1680439627983,66190

We have got some new faces as well so hopefully those guys play freely and express themselves. (On playing his 200th T20 game as captain) Exciting, I am really honored and grateful as well. It's been a long journey and it's something I will cherish. Look forward to playing many more games and hopefully we can achieve what we want. to achieve.",1680442435870,66190

post," I thought it was a phenomenal win, a homecoming after 4 years. Couldn't have asked for a better game. We bowled well for the first 17 overs but then credit to their batters especially Tilak who batted really well. It was a very comprehensive win and we wanted to win with balls to spare as it will benefit the NRR. The new ball was tricky, that's where we shifted the momentum, they can ride on that momentum from the last two overs of their batting but the way we started nullified all that momentum. We kept the pressure on the bowlers. Phenomenal, it was a packed crowd, every seat was full when we walked in here. Very important we started off well, their support propelled us and that makes a massive difference. I think he was phenomenal, phenomenal spell from him, that's brave bowling after getting the left-hander out [on Karn Sharma]. He was bowling so well for us last year but he couldn't play. Even in the nets he was not getting hit for sixes, hats off to him for coming and playing after so long, to perform  against such a strong MI side at the Chinnaswamy is great for him. I wanted to mention this for a while - after MI who have 5 titles and CSK who have 4, if I'm not wrong, we are the third team to have qualified the most times to the playoffs - 8 times.

We bowled well for the first 17 overs but then credit to their batters especially Tilak who batted really well. It was a very comprehensive win and we wanted to win with balls to spare as it will benefit the NRR. The new ball was tricky, that's where we shifted the momentum, they can ride on that momentum from the last two overs of their batting but the way we started nullified all that momentum. We kept the pressure on the bowlers. Phenomenal, it was a packed crowd, every seat was full when we walked in here. Very important we started off well, their support propelled us and that makes a massive difference. I think he was phenomenal, phenomenal spell from him, that's brave bowling after getting the left-hander out [on Karn Sharma]. He was bowling so well for us last year but he couldn't play. Even in the nets he was not getting hit for sixes, hats off to him for coming and playing after so long, to perform  against such a strong MI side at the Chinnaswamy is great for him. I wanted to mention this for a while - after MI who have 5 titles and CSK who have 4, if I'm not wrong, we are the third team to have qualified the most times to the playoffs - 8 times. Take one game at a time and try to be a balanced side which we are and we would look to execute our plans as we did tonight.",1680457687223,66190
post," Nice to start the way we did. In the powerplay, Siraj had the tail up and he set the tone. Right through the innings, our bowlers stuck to the plans. Obviously last 2-3 overs something to improve on. And that second innings, if you want to know how to chase a target, well, that's how you do it. If you took pace off the ball, it wasn't too easy to play and there was something in it for the spinners but as a batter if you got into good positions you could score runs. My first time playing here as a home player and it's a special player, especially batting with Virat Kohli. Energy bounces off him. You have to stay with the youngsters, I still work hard to be able to move around like I could in the young days. The confidence this gives, all of us are confidence players. This start will be huge for us as a team.",1680458139515,66190
