preview,"Gujarat come into this game after being on the receiving end of the most incredible IPL heist. They were on course for a third straight win before Rinku Singh happened.

I have worked on my batting and I get a lot of opportunity at the Titans (in the nets and in the match).",1681391680373,66253

I haven't played with Kohli yet, but I will enjoy talking to him once we play against them (RCB). I had a conversation with Kane Williamson as well, picking up things from great minds. Very happy to have conversations with such legends of the game, grateful for these opportunities.",1681392163974,66253

19.5," Sam Curran to Rahul Tewatia, ,  Goes down on his knee and scoops the length ball over short fine leg to seal the deal. Punches his chest to celebrate victory does the southpaw. Cool as a cucumber under pressure as the Titans get over the line. Was proving to be an excellent over by Sam Curran, but not enough on the day ",1681408180159,66253
post," Two ordinary batting performances from Punjab Kings and they have now lost back-to-back matches. Dhawan played a brilliant innings to save them from embarrassment against Sunrisers Hyderabad, but the Punjab captain failed to rise to the occasion tonight. Gujarat Titans bowlers bowled some tight lines and lengths to restrict PBKS in the middle overs, and although Shahrukh Khan struck a few late blows, they could only accumulate 153/8 in 20 overs. Mohit Sharma was pretty impressive on his IPL comeback, and as a result of his wily bowling spell, Punjab couldn't post a total that was threatening enough. In reply, Saha and Gill got them off a flying start, and although the former was dismissed within the powerplay, Gill anchored the innings till the final over. He was unfortunately dismissed by Curran in the final over, but Tewatia made sure to take them home with a nonchalant scoop over short fine leg. Stay around for the presentations..",1681408335690,66253

post," Agree with you on that thing. We did not put many runs on the board. We have to rectify that thing going forward. Absolutely - if you see the number of dot balls, if a team plays 56 balls, you end up losing the game. Losing early wickets puts you on the back foot and we need to work on that. Very proud of the bowlers, it was not a big total and taking the game till the end was tremendous. He came for practice yesterday, he pulled his muscle and another 2-3 days, he should be good to go [on Liam Livingstone's fitness].",1681408666170,66253

post," Wicket got a bit challenging in the end. Was harder to hit sixes with the old ball. It's a big ground. Was important to keep hitting the gaps, run as hard as possible. I should've finished the match. Rahul Tewatia and Kings XI is a love story. In these type of games, there's definitely pressure on both teams. It's about trying to minimise dot balls. It was difficult for them also to score runs against old ball. Was important to have a good powerplay. We ticked that box. It wasn't a big score. Was important to keep hitting the singles. He looked good in the nets also (Mohit). He has a good yorker. He bowled magnificently with the slower one, using the boundaries. Was a great GT debut for him.",1681408749786,66253

post," To be very honest I would not appreciate for the game to go this deep. There was definitely a lot for us to learn from this game. That's the beauty of sports, it's never over till it's over.  We need to go back to the drawing board. They bowled really well. Luckily all our batters are in good nick. We should take risks and play shots in the middle overs, need to make sure the game doesn't go so deep. The ball was getting dried up, but the wicket was a belter. Wasn't surprised when Mohit and Alzarri were bowling. He has done a lot of hard work, he has shown patience and his time has come [on Mohit]. It would have been a tough pill to swallow if the game had gone the other side. I would like to finish the game earlier, not a big fan of taking it to the last over.",1681409277959,66253

post," I have had a good time at this venue. I thought of sticking to my variations, had a chat with Hardik in the middle overs, luckily it paid off. You need to train hard, give your 100 percent. Need to bowl according to the situation, and stick to the basics. I was given a role to bowl after 10 overs. Credit goes to the coach who has defined everyone's role in the team.",1681409437073,66253

post,"This match should have gotten over much earlier given the start Gujarat Titans were off to, but the Punjab Kings bowlers pulled things back considerably in the second half of the run-chase. Seemed a bit dragged, but Gujarat will be glad as they are back to winning ways. Punjab Kings need to sort their batting soon, else it's going to be the same old story for them. That's all from our side tonight, we'll be back tomorrow with the live coverage between Kolkata Knight Riders and Sunrisers Hyderabad. Ciao for now!",1681409645211,66253
