preview," Hello everyone and welcome to our live coverage of Match 7 with Delhi Capitals taking on Gujarat Titans. Capitals had a forgettable start to their campaign against the Super Giants, and would look to take fresh guard as they return home after a long wait. The arrivals of Anrich Nortje and Lungi Ngidi would also be met with open arms after a toothless display with the ball in the opening game. But it's probably the batting that will need to gather themselves quickly having been ripped apart by the pace of Mark Wood at the last time of asking. The challenge doesn't get any easier today against a side that's known for its strong bowling attack that can excel in all types of conditions.",1680613260783,66204
preview," ""Dimensions - 64 metres either side, 70 metres down the ground. This wicket is smack bang in the middle. Remember what we saw a couple of weeks ago in the Test match, there was not a blade of grass to be seen. This wicket has a nice even covering of grass. This is an unbelievably flat wicket. I expect there will be a little bit more pace and a little bit more carry to assist the swing and the seam bowlers. But there are a couple of parts on this wicket that are very dry. Even though they are dry, don't expect that to have a huge influence on this game. 165 is the average score here. The trend of this tournament has been teams wanting to chase. Personally, I wouldn't be against trying to bat first, get a big total and try and put as much pressure on the opposition as you can.""",1680613786638,66204

preview," Going to bowl first. Not sure how the wicket is going to play. Obviously losing Kane - we're gutted. Especially for him. As a team we can manage, but gutted for him. Miller comes in for Kane. Sai Sudharsan comes in for Vijay. Not much talking in our team. Just about keeping things simple and focusing on controllables. Pitch looks fantastic.

He was brought in after the powerplay and after a loose first over, he rattled Capitals with some short stuff. The Titans didn't start off well with the new ball. Shami was quite erratic, though he did get two wickets. However once it was clear how much help there was from the pitch, Pandya continued to attack with his pacers. Rashid was brought on as late as the 13th over and he took a couple of wickets too. It was only thanks to some lusty blows from Axar Patel lower down the order that Capitals got to over 160.

post," It was funny at the start, we didn't know exactly what was happening but something was happening. We gave 15-20 runs extra in the powerplay. The way the bowlers pulled back was amazing. I go with my instinct, I like to back myself. I would rather back my own decision and fall down rather than thinking something else. Most often, I rather punch first rather than take the punch. We tell the boys to enjoy there. It helps you take the right decisions. Someone's putting their hand up. We have spoken about this. Taking care of each other is more important. He (Sai Sudharsan) is been batting terrifically. Credit to the support staff and to him as well. The amount of batting he's done in the last 15 days, all the result you see is all his hard work. Going forward, if I'm not wrong, in two years, he'll do something great for franchise cricket and eventually for India cricket as well.",1680632073913,66204

post," Thanks for backing me. A little bit nervous as this is my first time here. I was thinking what has to be done right. I wasn't under pressure, I was just calculating the right things. It was a bit low and skidding through, I was thinking to take the right options. My plan was to take the game deep and taking it through. Weathering the storm early on (was more satisfying). It was quite difficult, it was seaming initially, that was the highlight for me.",1680632098581,66204

post,"Two losses in two matches for Delhi Capitals. They were rattled by Mark Wood in their previous game and found Alzarri Joseph too hot to handle today who removed Warner and Rossouw off successive deliveries. Shami and Rashid picked three wickets apiece to restrict the Capitals to the lowest first innings total of the season. In reply, Sai Sudharsan played a classy knock and stitched a couple of half-century partnerships as Gujarat Titans romped home to win two in two. On that note, it's time to bring the curtains down on this encounter. The action shifts to Guwahati tomorrow where Rajasthan Royals will locks horns against Punjab Kings. Don't forget to tune in for that. Until then, it's goodbye from ,  and .",1680632288109,66204
