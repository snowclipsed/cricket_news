preview," Whisper it slowly but the Ekana Cricket Stadium is looking like a real fortress for LSG. They smashed Delhi on a red soil wicket and used spin to win against Sunrisers. Two thumping home wins, on two very different kinds of surfaces - always the sign of a team in full swing. And they head into this game full of confidence, after chasing down 212 against Bangalore in Bangalore in that thrilling contest. Their overseas batters Marcus Stoinis and Nicholas Pooran are firing, their bowlers are bowling full tilt. The only missing ingredient has been skipper KL Rahul getting some runs, maybe that too could happen today…",1681562947716,66264
preview,"Opponents Punjab started the 2023 IPL season with two wins - the first time they won back-to-back since 2020. However, they have slumped to consecutive defeats now with a rather tepid batting performance in both those games. It has been a case of Shikhar Dhawan or bust for PBKS this season, with the odd contributions from Prabhsimran Singh and Bhanuka Rajapaksa. Their batting order needs to really push their weight now, and the potential inclusion of Liam Livingstone could do them a world of good. Bowling has been better for PBKS this season, especially death bowling but a little more from Kagiso Rabada and Rahul Chahar would be helpful. We’re not too far away from the toss, stick around for toss and team updates…. and of course the pitch report!",1681563215122,66264

preview," The preparation is the same for me personally no matter what tournament. I believe in the processes that I’ve followed for the last 3-4 years. No difference in the way I prepare because I’ve played International cricket, because I believe I’ve played Internationals because of these processes. Personally, I prefer playing top-order like I have in domestic cricket but I like to play the situation more than the batting number.",1681564628750,66264

preview," We'll bowl first. Something we haven't done all season so just needed a change up. Also our first toss that we have won this season. Shilkhar picked up an injury last game, don't know how bad it is but hopefully he won't be out long. His absence is huge, we've got two Indian batters coming in and Raza is back in the XI. The conditions looks good",1681565447936,66264
preview," First game on this strip, anything would have worked. It is exciting to challenge ourselves on different conditions. It is our first season here, so each game we'll assess and modify. Every game we make a few changes, settle on a 12-13 and take a call depending on the game. Each game we have turned up and we have been challenged every time, but players have found answers. Everyone is enjoying the game and there is a good vibe around, really happy with the support we have got out here.",1681565527140,66264

post," What's with IPL 2023, seriously! New day, new heroes and another cracker of a game! Batting has been Punjab's weaker suit, and again they struggled today while chasing a target that wasn't very daunting. But a fifty from Sikandar Raza turned it on for them at the right time. His takedown of Krunal Pandya got the rate well within reach, and then Shahrukh Khan, who took some lovely catches earlier in the evening, stepped up in the death overs to get them over the line. The way he started his little cameo, with a six first ball off Mark Wood, was a good indication that he was on tonight. And despite Bishnoi doing a terrific job to keep Lucknow in the game, it wasn't enough. There was heavy dew on the outfield, as Shahrukh himself verified during the mid-innings break, and that made Lucknow's job quite hard as well. But again, their approach through those middle overs with the bat was debatable to say the least as they finished with just 159.",1681581697801,66264

post," We were about 10 short, the dew came in and helped the batters a bit more. We didnt do too well with the ball. (On what is a par score here) When your'e playing on a new pitch, you cant rely on previous games so we are taking it as it comes. Assessing it as it comes to think what would be a par total. If a few guys get going, we can get that 180-190 mark like Mayers and Pooran played well in that DC game, but unfortunately today a few batters got caught on the boundary lines. If they went over, the score could have been different. Part of the game, we learn from it. (On his diving catch) Game on the line, you have to give it everything on the field. I saw the ball and went for it. (On finding balance between aggression and anchoring) Each player has a different role, we are 7-8 batters in our team and few are powerful enough to clear every boundary, the others have different skills. We each play our role and thats what makes the team exciting. We have power in Pooran and Stoin, and Mayers up top takes the aggressive route. For each player taking that aggressive route can look different, you have to stick to what works best for you.",1681582270090,66264

post,"- Really feeling good, after the first innings,. it was important to play a par game (in the chase). Raza played superbly and set it up for me. My mindset was just to stay with the ball, the practice is working out to me. I'm powerful, cheeky shots don't work for me, so I try to hit straight and it's good to use my muscles. I just told Brar to go for the big hit since it was the last (5th) ball of the over, unfortunately he got out, but I was confident I could finish in the last over.",1681582297827,66264

post," Amazing win. I thought our spinners bowled nicely. KG does what he does. Bit of dew came in but the wicket was offering a little for the bowlers. The way Sikandar Raza played was brilliant. And the way Shahrukh finished it, that's what he's in our team to do. His role has been clear in our side. Players who can hit sixes from ball one are dangerous. You go from ground to ground - different dimensions - have to come up with different gameplans. We've got so many options which is lovely to have as a captain. I've never done it before. Hopefully Shikhar is fit soon.",1681582826399,66264

It's one of the biggest stage. You're here and you want to do well. I've had two average games which was there in my head. Jitesh's wicket was very crucial. Had he stayed on for 6-8 balls, he would've finished the game himself. But the way Shahrukh came out hitting his first ball for six, I was confident in him.",1681582968265,66264

The pitch might've been different before the dew came in, but with such potential in that Lucknow middle order, this particular approach might just be selling them short.
