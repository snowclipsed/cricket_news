0.3," Short to Mayers, , off the mark with six!! This was on the pads and Mayers just lofts his sweep over deep backward square leg. That is the short boundary, saisl away for six!! ",1681567329143
1.4," Arshdeep Singh to Rahul, , on the pads and too full, very gently tickled to the right of short fine for a boundary ",1681567648265
2.2," Rabada to Mayers, , back of length and leaving the batter, Mayers goes back to punch and the ball flies off the outside edge for a boundary!! ",1681567848807
2.5," Rabada to Rahul, , up and over, classic KL Rahul!! Rabada steaming in at 140 clicks, bowls it fuller on off and Rahul just effortlessly lifts his drive over extra cover. Bounces once and goes after... ",1681567975798
3.6,"Sam Curran to Mayers, , up and over for six!! A classic Kyle Mayers shot as Curran gives his width outside off and bowls it shorter. Mayers arches his back and punches it over covers and all the way for six. It was the cutter as well, so all power from Mayers on that. Most others who try that shot could have a back muscle pull, but when Kyle Mayers does it it goes for six...",1681568259937
4.5," Rabada to Mayers, , what a shot!! The disrespect shown to a premier overseas bowler is almost commendable. This was short on the body at good pace, Mayers made room and pulls it high and handsomely into the stands beyond deep mid-wicket. He's beginning to take off again... ",1681568459680
5.1," Harpreet Brar to Rahul, , too short with width, not the length you bowl in the powerplay. Rahul gets back and cuts it between covers and point for a boundary ",1681568582335
6.4," Short to Rahul, 1 run, short and wide, cut square of the wicket for a single ",1681568879815
7.4," Harpreet Brar to Mayers,  Caught by Harpreet Singh!! Gone!! Harpreet Brar deserves this breakthrough. He kept Mayers quiet with a few dots balls, and then pushed a half tracker onto leg. Was there to be hit but Mayers gets it off the bottom of the bat on the pull and holes out to deep square leg. Nice low catch by the fielder running in from the fence.  ",1681569162165
8.2," Raza to Rahul, , fired in flat on off, Rahul backed away and almost gave away his middle stump. Gets some bat on his cut and the ball takes a flying edge towards the third-man boundary ",1681569444997
8.4,"Raza to Hooda,  Lbw!! One wicket brings another!! This was a flat and straight ball onto middle, Hooda shuffled inwards for a big slog but completely misses the line and length. Struck bang in front of middle for one of the easiest LBW decisions the umpire has to give today. ",1681569531438
9.1," Sam Curran to Rahul, , good length on off, skiddy delivery. Rahul expertly threads it between short third and backward point on the cut. Maybe Rabada at short third could have done better, but superb strokeplay from KL Rahul ",1681569867751
9.4," Sam Curran to Krunal Pandya, , brilliant!! Short pitched and just outside off, Pandya with a shimmy inwards to pull it to the right of deep backward square leg. In the gap for a boundary... ",1681569987786
10.5," Raza to Krunal Pandya, , leg byes, , that's the problem with Raza. Bowls five good balls and then skews one completely off the radar. This was an attempted yorker that goes down leg, deflects off the pads towards the fine leg boundary. And it is also a no ball... ",1681570304375
10.5," Raza to Krunal Pandya, , flat and spinning away outside off. Pandya gets closer and chips it over point for a boundary. Well played! ",1681570314892
12.2," Arshdeep Singh to Rahul, , short of length again, Rahul backs away and slaps it over mid-on for a boundary. Finally a release shot from the LSG skipper, a rare show of aggresion! ",1681570755410
12.4," Arshdeep Singh to Krunal Pandya, 1 run, slower delivery, foxed Pandya who was way too early on his big drive. Uppish but tamely towards mid-wicket - safe with the fielders all deep ",1681570863731
13.1," Rahul Chahar to Rahul, , , loopy delivery on off, KL gets a good stride forward and then hammers the drive back over the bowler's head, bounces away straight of long-off, raises his fifty as well ",1681571059374
14.2,"Rabada to Krunal Pandya,  Caught by Shahrukh Khan!! Excellent grab by Shahrukh at deep mid-wicket and KG has struck on his comeback - was bowled short and at the stumps, Krunal rocked back and it made a cracking sound, and he was hitting it to the shorter boundary - Shahrukh was well placed inside the ropes, took the catch moving sideways, realised that he was going to trod onto the advertisement skirtings - lobbed the ball in the air, settled himself, came back and then took it on the rebound. The TV umpire has a few looks and he's happy that it's a clean catch - OUT is the signal on the big screen. An innings that was labouring around has ended. ",1681571412593
14.3,"Rabada to Pooran,  Caught by Shahrukh Khan!! A first-ball duck for Pooran,m that's the roll of the dice goes in the IPL. Was the hero at the Chinnswamy, but could he have taken some time on this challenging surface? On a length and just outside off - Pooran was looking to heave it to the shorter boundary - dragged it slightly high on the bat, plenty of elevation and no real distance. A sitter for Shahrukh as he got under it at deep mid-wicket - LSG losing their way slightly here. ",1681571763429
15.3,"Rahul Chahar to Stoinis, , , another leg-break from Chahar, but this is a tad too full and allows Stoinis to get under it - played with the spin and gets enough elevation on the shot to clear long-off, who was pretty straight",1681572207757
15.4," Rahul Chahar to Stoinis, , back-to-back sixes for Stoinis - poor ball from Chahar, dropped short and Stoinis has plenty of time to rock back on the pull, he does so and powers it over mid-wicket for a maximum ",1681572241817
16.4," Rabada to Rahul, , , innocous delivery from KG, width on offer and KL doesn't miss out, cuts it hard and over deep point for a maximum - was the shorter boundary and he cleared the leaping fielder ",1681572505481
16.5," Rabada to Rahul, , banged in short and at the stumps, KL lets it go on height, but it's not called as a wide, , he's in a slightly crouched position, but since it's gone above his head, the 3rd umpire reckons it's a wide for height, so a good review from KL ",1681572634439
16.5," Rabada to Rahul, 1 run, that'll go down as a half-chance, but KG hardly had time to react, on a length and just outside off, was flat-batted powerfully back at the bowler, hit KG on his knees even before he could react ",1681572657094
17.5," Sam Curran to Stoinis,  Caught by Jitesh Sharma!! Appeal for a  and . Curran was very confident, wasn't given as a wide either, did it flick the glove on its way to the keeper? The bat is close to the glove - onto UltraEdge and there's a spike when the ball is right next to the glove - it's a clear spike and the decision has to be reversed, Stoinis is OUT. An unfortunate way to go and that could make a difference of at least 15-20 runs - short and down leg, Stoinis was looking to help it on its way with the pull and ends up getting strangled down the leg-side. Jitesh Sharma wasn't so sure, but the stand-in captain was and he earns a wicket for himself.  ",1681573081213
18.2," Arshdeep Singh to Rahul, , , short and angling across the right-hander, KL sidesteps, gets inside the line and then ramps it over short third man for a boundary, can he get LSG to around 170? ",1681573303225
18.3," Arshdeep Singh to Rahul, 2 runs, low full-toss from Arshdeep, was looking for the yorker, ficked to the right of long-on and KL is back for the second ",1681573350088
18.4,"Arshdeep Singh to Rahul,  Caught by (sub)Nathan Ellis!! .. and he strikes with the angle, was the knuckle ball, was bowled into the surface and cramped KL for room on the shovel - hit very high on the bat and lobs a simple catch to Ellis, who is stationed at long-on. Punjab roaring back into the contest with timely wickets. ",1681573439107
19.3," Sam Curran to Gowtham,  Caught by Raza!! The impact player has holed out to long-off, was bowled into the suface and was another slower ball - Gowtham was looking to force it away, hit low on the bat and spooned a dolly down to Raza at long-off - Punjab finishing on a high here.  ",1681573768663
19.4," Sam Curran to Yudhvir Singh,  Caught by Shahrukh Khan!! Another sharp catch at long-on and it's Shahrukh Khan once again. Was right in front of the ropes as he took the catch, he knew he was going to step onto the skirtings, lobs the ball up, goes over the ropes, comes back and then takes it on the rebound. But was his feet touching the rope as he completed the catch? The 3rd umpire is having several looks, he wants it to be zoomed and it's clear that he's not touched the rope - . Hard length doing the trick for Curran, was the slower short ball and Charak had to drag the pull, hit it straight and down to long-on.  ",1681573948382
0.3," Yudhvir Singh to Atharva Taide,  Caught by Avesh Khan!! A duck on debut for Taide and Yudhvir Singh is chuffed to bits. Nerves playing on Atharva's mind here - short of a length and angling into the left-hander, Atharva swung across the line, is through with the shot early and the big top-edge goes all the way to third man - Avesh runs in and completes a simple catch.  ",1681575147633
1.1," Avesh Khan to Short, , , tad too short from Avesh, Short is quick to read the length, swivels across and then drills the pull past mid-wicket for a boundary ",1681575412445
1.3," Avesh Khan to Short, , , length ball angling into the pads, Short gets inside the line, brings his wrists into play and flicks it off his hips, behind square on the on-side for a boundary ",1681575492070
1.4," Avesh Khan to Short, , , Short has started well, short of a good length and just outside off, he stands tall and then drives it on the rise, finds the gap square past point for a boundary ",1681575537262
2.1," Yudhvir Singh to Prabhsimran, , , banged in short by Yudhvir - Prabhsimran swivels across on the pull, didn't get it off the middle, but has enough for the ball to dribble away to the ropes ",1681575673752
2.2," Yudhvir Singh to Prabhsimran,  Bowled!! An overambitious drive and Prabhsimran has lost his off-stump - on a good length and shaping back into the right-hander - Prabhsimran's feet hardly moved, he didn't account for rthe movement and then tried to drive it through cover. The ball goes right through the massive bat-pad gap and sends the off-stump cartwheeing. A dream LSG debut for Yudhvir, has accounted for both Punjab openers.  ",1681575709329
2.6,"Yudhvir Singh to Harpreet Singh, , , fuller length delivery on the pads, Bhatia leans across and then whips it over mid-wicket, bounces away to the ropes in a hurry",1681575961356
4.1," Yudhvir Singh to Short, , , too short from Charak and the Australian doesn't miss out - stays on the front-foot and then powers the pull over mid-wicket for a bounbdary ",1681576354568
4.2," Yudhvir Singh to Short, , , width on offer and Short climbs into the cut - gets on top of the bounce and lashes it square past cover, no one moved an inch ",1681576417262
5.4," Gowtham to Short, , , tad too full from Gowtham, lets Short gets underneath the lofted drive and he then sends it soaring over long-on for a maximum ",1681576774300
5.6,"Gowtham to Short,  Caught by Stoinis!! Oh dear! This is such a giveaway, no wonder Short looks so annoyed with himself - was tossed up around off and Short was looking to go inside out with the drive. But he hit it a lot straighter, went with hard hands and punched it straight down Stoinis's throat at mid-off, who reverse-cups it with ease. Short was looking so good once again, but his innings has been badly cut short. ",1681576841818
7.2," Mark Wood to Raza, 1 run, 146kph, good length on middle, Raza hops back in defence and squirts it off a thick edge through backward point ",1681577280695
8.4," Krunal Pandya to Harpreet Singh, , nicely done! 103kph, length ball sliding away outside off, and Harpreet waits for it before using the pace. He dabs it fine into the third man boundary for four ",1681577625453
10.2," Krunal Pandya to Harpreet Singh, , flat length ball sliding across off, Harpreet makes room and slaps it over extra cover! They're looking to get a move on now ",1681578169138
10.6," Krunal Pandya to Harpreet Singh,  Caught by Yudhvir Singh!! Harpreet looks to go big but Krunal fires it into the pads, denying him the swinging room. Harpreet still swipes across the line, hitting it straight to deep backward square. He was looking to take on the left-arm spinner in this over. Perishes in doing so.  ",1681578287342
11.3," Gowtham to Raza, , steps out and whacks it for six! This time Raza is able to get close enough to the pitch of the delivery and goes through with the lofted hit down the ground ",1681578429843
12.2," Krunal Pandya to Raza, , hasn't quite got hold of the pull, but he still clears Yudhvir at the boundary! Excellent effort from the debutant there as he jumps and tries to hold on, but his momentum takes him over. Was the short boundary at just 68 meters ",1681578590936
12.3," Krunal Pandya to Raza, , another pull, and again he only just beats Yudhvir who gets a hand as he jumps full stretch but isn't able to flick it back! Tantalising stuff! Rahul not happy with Krunal dropping it on the shorter side. But Raza hasn't quite nailed his two pull shots either which have gone for sixes towards the short boundary ",1681578624458
12.4," Krunal Pandya to Raza, , would you believe it, again the pull shot only just evades Yudhvir! It's following him like a magnet! Pulled in the air, Yudhvir runs across to his left, dives but doesn't get a hand this time ",1681578715125
13.1," Gowtham to Raza, , excellent from Raza as there's a flurry of boundaries for PBKS! Fired in on a length around leg stump, Raza bends across, uses the pace and paddles it fine ",1681578818553
14.2," Ravi Bishnoi to Sam Curran, , now he connects! Another googly outside off, turns away off a length to give Curran width, and he slaps it over extra cover ",1681579108451
14.3," Ravi Bishnoi to Sam Curran,  Caught by Krunal Pandya!! Another googly outside off, Curran tries to go straighter this time, and he holes out at long-off. Probably should've gone over extra cover again as it was quite wide. But he tries a flat-batted shot down the ground and doesn't connect very well. Bishnoi celebrates with the star man pose.  ",1681579151364
15.3," Mark Wood to Raza, , 144.6kph, short of length into the body, and Raza has played this beautifully! The ball isn't high enough to trouble him here! He swivels across, gets on top of the bounce and pulls it wide of fine leg ",1681579500492
15.4," Mark Wood to Raza, , Raza is gesturing that this bouncer went over his head. He has gone for a review after the umpire doesn't signal a wide. It's banged in short, Raza bends his head slightly, and the third umpire reckons it would've been over his head even if he was standing straight ",1681579649310
15.4," Mark Wood to Raza, 1 run, sharp bouncer around head level, and Raza almost flinches as he pulls this through square leg. The single takes him to  - his first in the IPL ",1681579676186
15.5,"Mark Wood to Jitesh Sharma,  Caught by Rahul!!  He dives full stretch, goes with both hands, and just about clings on with his fingertips! Full and fast around off, Jitesh looks to drive but slices it wide of mid-off. It's going away from Rahul and he has some distance to cover as well before unleashing the dive. And he pulls it off! ",1681579733279
15.6," Mark Wood to Shahrukh Khan, , wow, just wow! To walk out and do that first ball to Mark Wood! Shahrukh Khan, are you for real! Speared in full just outside off, Shahrukh gets forward and smokes it over long-on. Oh what a hit! ",1681580021113
16.1," Avesh Khan to Raza, 2 runs, what's happened here? LSG believe they've got Raza run out! But no they haven't. No they haven't.  Back of a length around off, Raza taps it through point, turns around for the second and puts in a full length dive ",1681580239365
16.6," Avesh Khan to Raza, , drilled, absolutely drilled! Overpitched outside off as Avesh goes for another wide yorker, and Raza smashes the cover off it with a spanking drive through extra cover. It was Brook yesterday, and now it's Raza turn to announce his arrival after a few scratchy innings to start off ",1681580477412
17.2," Ravi Bishnoi to Shahrukh Khan, , 99kph, length ball sliding down leg, Shahrukh tries to paddle it fine but misses. Oh they've taken a review. Umpire had signalled a wide, but Pooran is convinced he got some bat/glove there. . Let's wait for UltraEdge to find out what Pooran heard. There's nothing on it. Flat line throughout ",1681580683296
17.5," Ravi Bishnoi to Raza,  Caught by Stoinis!! What an over this is from Bishnoi to keep Lucknow alive! Just two runs off his first four balls, and now the wicket of Raza! The advantage he has is that the leg-side boundary is huge! Raza tries taking it on with the slog-sweep, doesn't connect well, and Stoinis charges in from deep backward square for a safe catch.  ",1681580812795
18.2," Mark Wood to Shahrukh Khan, ,  Two balls against Wood, two sixes for Shahrukh! 143kph, short of length into the body, Shahrukh goes hard on the pull but it gets big on him before flying over the keeper's head ",1681581143824
18.4," Mark Wood to Harpreet Brar, , this is some treatment Wood is getting. Harpreet Brar, you beauty! He steps away from the stumps, Wood tries following him with a full delivery at 148kph. But he ends up offering a half-volley which is crashed through extra cover ",1681581241779
18.5," Mark Wood to Harpreet Brar,  Caught by Pooran!! Wood strikes back, PBKS eight down! Harpreet backs away again, gets a length ball angled into him at 147kph and swings across the line. But all he can do is nick it to the keeper. Oh these games just refuse to be without drama.  ",1681581293987
19.3," Ravi Bishnoi to Shahrukh Khan, , that's it,  What a knock this has been! And Bishnoi, who did such a great job to keep his team in the game, finally gets it slightly wrong. He bowls this too full outside off, and Shahrukh hammers it wide of long-off to seal the win ",1681581542431
