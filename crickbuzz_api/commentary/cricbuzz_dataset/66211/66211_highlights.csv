0.5," Siraj to Gurbaz, , not great fielding at third man, not a great delivery either! Back of a length outside off, plenty of width for Gurbaz who cuts crisply past backward point. Third man does well to get there after running across, but fumbles and it rolls into the boundary ",1680789836765
2.3," Siraj to Gurbaz, ,  139kph, short of length outside off, and there's plenty of width for Gurbaz. He throws his hands at it and smokes it through point ",1680790351685
2.4," Siraj to Gurbaz, byes, , ! Karthik is beaten behind the stumps as well! Back of a length on off, Gurbaz hangs back to defend but it nips in, goes right through him and bounces over the stumps. The movement is too much to deal with for the keeper ",1680790402827
2.5," Siraj to Gurbaz, , short of length outside off, Gurbaz initially shimmies down but then adjusts well to the length. He's helped by the width as well. Gets on top of the bounce, opens the face and guides it past short third ",1680790436173
3.2," Willey to Venkatesh Iyer,  Bowled!! Sharp movement off the seam, bit of low bounce, and Iyer's stumps are rattled! Willey is pumped! It's a short of length delivery just outside off, Iyer tries punching off the back foot but it cuts back in sharply. Usually the ball would go over the stumps from that length. But not here. It beats the inside edge and crashes into middle and leg!  ",1680790616792
3.3," Willey to Mandeep,  Bowled!! , and this one's an absolute beauty from Willey! Good length delivery slanted away from over the wicket at around 126kph. It pitches around leg, Mandeep gets tentatively forward to defend but it nips away sharply to beat the edge before smashing off stump. Mandeep got completely squared up. I ",1680790730373
4.2," Akash Deep to Gurbaz, , , 138.6kph, short of length into the body, and Gurbaz swivels across nicely to pull it over short fine leg for six. It's a no-ball as well with Akash Deep overstepping ",1680791056281
4.5," Akash Deep to Gurbaz, leg byes, , that's a poor call from the ump. Clearly came off the bat. Back of a length around off, Gurbaz shuffles across and expertly glances it past short fine for four ",1680791219211
5.3," Willey to Gurbaz, , 127kph, short of length around off, sits up for Gurbaz who whacks the pull over midwicket. Not the length Willey can afford to bowl at his pace ",1680791419370
6.1," M Bracewell to Nitish Rana,  Caught by Karthik!!  Rana tries a reverse-sweep off Bracewell's first ball, but it pops up in the air for the keeper. Oh that's come straight off the glove. Having watched the replay, Rana is already walking off before the third umpire can confirm the decision.  ",1680791704806
6.5," M Bracewell to Gurbaz, 2 runs, length ball pitching outside off, turns in sharply on middle and leg, and Gurbaz clips it through midwicket ",1680791902832
7.1," Shahbaz Ahmed to Gurbaz, no run, given out LBW and . It did look like it came off the glove in real time, and not the pad. And the replay confirms the same. It's tossed up on middle, Gurbaz goes for a sweep and gets hit on the glove ",1680792068697
7.5," Shahbaz Ahmed to Gurbaz, , this ball is so far wide outside off, but Gurbaz still manages to fetch it as he nails the sweep through square leg! ",1680792174595
8.2," M Bracewell to Gurbaz, ,  Floated up outside off, too full from Bracewell and Gurbaz nails the slog-sweep over wide long-on ",1680792282726
8.5," M Bracewell to Gurbaz, , slightly short, not that much, but Gurbaz rocks back and pulls over midwicket. Don't think he middled it, but it's good enough ",1680792364952
9.2," Karn Sharma to Gurbaz, ,  He's scored more than two-thirds of KKR's runs so far. Floated up around middle, Gurbaz gets low and hits it flat over the long leg boundary ",1680792631281
10.6," Harshal Patel to Rinku Singh, , poor delivery and Rinku makes him pay! Length ball down the leg-side, normal pace delivery, and Rinku whips it over short fine ",1680793016723
11.2," Karn Sharma to Gurbaz,  Caught by Akash Deep!! Gurbaz throws his head back in agony as the catch is taken! He went for the reverse-sweep but couldn't keep it down. And a good catch from Akash Deep diving across at short third sends him packing after a good knock.  ",1680793139788
11.3," Karn Sharma to Russell,  Caught by Kohli!!  It's a legbreak floated up around off, lands in the slot and Russell doesn't hold back despite having just arrived to the crease. He winds up and swings hard but doesn't get hold of it. Comfortably taken at long-off by Kohli. Karn has two in two!  ",1680793243608
11.4," Karn Sharma to Thakur, , nearly a hattrick for Karn! Plenty of flight on this legbreak, Thakur looks to drive but drags it off a thick inside edge past leg stump. Willey fails to keep it inside the boundary ",1680793332281
12.1," Akash Deep to Thakur, , back of a length delivery straying on leg, Thakur shuffles across and manages to tickle it fine. The outfield is lightning fast and fine leg is unable to cut it off ",1680793496784
12.2," Akash Deep to Thakur, , 137.4kph, full outside off, and Thakur throws his hands at it to carve it over extra cover ",1680793537818
12.6," Akash Deep to Thakur, , goes for a leg-stump yorker, doesn't quite get it right and Thakur launches it over long-on to make the most of this free-hit ",1680793821965
13.6," Karn Sharma to Thakur, , Shardul is crystal-clear in how he wants to approach this innings. I0$ He sinks to one knee, fetches the quicker full delivery from just outside off and slams the slogsweep in the gap between deep mid-wicket and long-on.  ",1680794046969
14.4," M Bracewell to Thakur, , Shardul is smoking it to all corners. Skates down the pitch and to his delight, the ball spins right into the arc from a juicy length and he's nailed that many-a-mile into the mid-wicket stands ",1680794201952
14.5," M Bracewell to Thakur, , and again! SRK is happy in the stands. Uses his feet once again, the offbreak turns in from a good length and Shardul sends it soaring over mid-wicket for a mighty maximum ",1680794232640
15.2," Willey to Thakur, , the slower short ball from David Willey. Shardul stands tall and flat-bats the forehand slap. Hit that so hard that Rinku Singh had to duck for cover and it flies past the diving right hand of mid-off ",1680794405693
16.2," Harshal Patel to Thakur, , make way for  Fetches the short ball from outside off and hammers the pull for a one-bounce boundary over mid-wicket. The dug-out is happy, owners are happy and so is his partner at the other end... ",1680794824874

17.2," Siraj to Thakur, , ""I0$,"" says Sanjay Manjrekar on air. It's a full ball outside off and thumped off the strong bottom hand straight of mid-off ",1680795193077
17.5," Siraj to Rinku Singh, , , high full toss and signalled a no-ball rightly. Rinku Singh crouches and laps it over the keeper for a maximum. RCB have reviewed and it's clearly above the waist even if Rinku had stayed upright at the crease. The onfield verdict stays...freehit coming up... ",1680795303198
18.1," Harshal Patel to Rinku Singh, no run, , not to be. Rinku looks to slog and gets a thick inside edge onto pad. The ball rolls to the right of the bowler who tries for a direct hit at the bowling end, Thakur was backing up a little too far and would have been out despite the dive... ",1680795529135
18.2," Harshal Patel to Rinku Singh, , skates down the pitch and thumps it back over the bowler's head, timed it really well did Rinku Singh ",1680795565546

18.4," Harshal Patel to Rinku Singh, , flat six!  Advances, fetches the slower length delivery from outside off and wallops it neatly over wide long-on ",1680795671983
18.6," Harshal Patel to Rinku Singh,  Caught by Karthik!! No celebrations in the RCB camp. Rinku Singh almost waits for umpire Virender Sharma to raise his finger. Walks off reluctantly. A straightforward decision that. Slower short ball dug into the surface, extracts plenty of bounce and snicks the glove on the attempted pull. Lobs up comfortably for DK behind the stumps.  ",1680795759545
19.1," Siraj to Thakur, , full toss outside off, Shardul slaps it over extra cover with disdain. Gee, this lad's got some bottom hand power... ",1680795854511
19.4," Siraj to Thakur,  Caught by Maxwell!! One-handed six? Nope. Gone. Siraj digs in the slower ball bumper, gets a tennis-ball like bounce and it messes up with the timing of Shardul Thakur. Looks for the pull and the bottom hand comes off the blade before completing the bat swing, loops up off the top-edge and Maxi settles under it at long-on.  ",1680796007476
19.5," Siraj to Umesh Yadav, , when Umesh Yadav hits, it stays hit. Gives it all on this mighty hack and he's got enough power to clear mid-off.  ",1680796090068
0.1," Umesh Yadav to Kohli, , Virat Kohli was casually shaking his head listening to the peppy music from DJ before the first ball and he's dispatched the first ball with supreme ease. A half-volley down leg and it's been clipped away to the fine leg fence with great timing ",1680797379629
0.6," Umesh Yadav to Kohli, , the starter was served first ball of the over, Kohli was waiting for the main course and Umesh Yadav is kind enough to offer it real quick. A short and wide hit-me, Kohli frees his hands and scythes it in the gap between short third and backward point ",1680797546990
2.5," Umesh Yadav to du Plessis, , anything full and Faf ain't gonna let that go scot-free. The bat face turns on impact but he's got enough power on the lofted drive over extra cover ",1680797986625
3.1," Southee to Kohli, , skips down the track, meets the ball on a fuller length and tonks it back over the bowler's head with absolute disdain. Sheer dominance from Virat Kohli... ",1680798081898
3.3," Southee to du Plessis, , fullish length outside off, Faf clears his front leg and sends it soaring straight down the ground for a maximum ",1680798167381
3.4," Southee to du Plessis, , full and wide, Faf flays it over extra cover with terrific timing! Save your legs. ",1680798208576
3.5," Southee to du Plessis, , Tim Southee is getting belted to all corners. Slower full delivery at the pads, Faf picks it up nonchalantly and whips it deep into the mid-wicket stands... ",1680798251433
4.5," Narine to Kohli,  Bowled!! Knocks him over. The classic offbreak. Bowls it on an in-between length and gets the ball to spin enough to hit the top of off. Kohli wasn't fully forward, tries to flick leg-side but ends up playing down the wrong line and pays the price.  ",1680798467234
5.2,"Chakaravarthy to du Plessis,  Bowled!! Did someone just click on the replay of Kohli's dismissal? The only difference is an inside edge. Once again the lack of footwork is very evident. Faf tries to force a fullish delivery from outside off through the off-side and skews it off the thick inside edge onto his middle and off. Wasn't really forward neither back. Timber! It was a googly and the RCB skipper clearly didn't pick it. ",1680798720192
5.5," Chakaravarthy to Maxwell, , full and wide of off, Maxwell forces the drive on the up and puts it in the gap between cover and extra cover ",1680798874417
7.2," Chakaravarthy to Maxwell,  Bowled!!  This one is quicker and flatter on a length outside off, Maxwell tries something audacious as he tries to hammer it across the line but the ball turns in, beats the inside edge, and crashes into the off-stump. Always a risk trying to play across the line on a track where the ball is gripping and turning. RCB are in big trouble.  ",1680799218625
7.4," Chakaravarthy to Harshal Patel,  Bowled!! The promotion for Harshal Patel up the order fails! The back of the hand ball from Chakaravarthy outside off, there's some room on offer as well. Harshal Patel tries to cash in as he goes for an expansive drive. However, he gets an inside edge that crashes into the stumps. All the four wickets have fallen to poor shots you can say. Yes, the spinners have bowled well but it has been irresponsible from the RCB batters.  ",1680799372067
8.2," Narine to Shahbaz Ahmed, byes, , some respite for RCB! Full ball outside off, Shahbaz Ahmed goes for a sweep but misses. Gurbaz is put off as he gets beaten and the ball races to the fence ",1680799609944
8.5," Narine to Shahbaz Ahmed,  Caught by Thakur!!  Everything happening too quickly! They have lost four wickets only for 17 runs. Tossed up full ball outside off, Shahbaz Ahmed reverses his stance and goes for the reverse hit. Makes good connection but he fails to find the gap. Thakur at deep backward point takes an easy catch.  ",1680799696038

10.3," Suyash Sharma to M Bracewell, , poor ball and duly punished! A half-tracker, asking to be hit, Bracewell doesn't miss out as he smokes the pull over deep mid-wicket for a maximum ",1680800284211
11.1," Thakur to Karthik, ,  A shortish ball outside off, Karthik stands tall and nails the pull through mid-wicket. No chance for the man in deep to cut it off ",1680800477214
11.3,"Thakur to M Bracewell,  Caught by Nitish Rana!!  The stars have aligned for him and he can do nothing wrong tonight. A sharp short ball around leg, Bracewell doesn't have much space to work with but he still goes for a hook shot. Ends up gloving it towards short fine leg. Rana runs in a bit and dives to take a fine catch. ",1680800577512
12.2,"Suyash Sharma to Anuj Rawat,  Caught by Narine!!  Big moment for the youngster. He is cock-a-hoop! Tossed up outside off and spinning away, Anuj Rawat kneels down and tries to slog sweep it against the spin but only manages to get a top-edge. The ball lobs towards short third man and Narine pouches it gleefully! ",1680800891250
12.5," Suyash Sharma to Karthik,  Caught by Chakaravarthy!! KKR are ruling the roost at Eden Gardens! The youngster gets the better of Karthik and it is definitely a moment for him worth cherishing! Tossed up full ball outside off, Karthik goes for an expansive drive through covers but only manages to get it off the outer half of his bat. The ball lobs towards short third man. Chakravarthy moves to his right and catches it. KKR only two wickets away from a big victory.  ",1680801128189
13.3," Thakur to Willey, , shot! Back of a length ball outside off, Willey stands tall and punches it crisply through covers for a rocketing boundary ",1680801537931
14.3," Suyash Sharma to Karn Sharma,  Caught by Nitish Rana!! Tossed up ball, Karn Sharma tries to slog sweep it but seems to have missed it to be rapped on the pads. The ball also lobs to Rana at slip and he takes it. A loud shout follows but the umpire stays put. Suyash Sharma is confident and KKR take the review. UltraEdge shows there's an edge. So, the catch is checked and Rana took it cleanly.  ",1680801896891
14.6," Suyash Sharma to Akash Deep, , tossed up ball around off, Akash Deep kneels down and slog sweeps it over mid-wicket for a one-bounce boundary ",1680802076843
15.6," Narine to Akash Deep, , on a length outside off, Akash Deep kneels down and tries to hit it across the line but only manages an under edge. Goes through Gurbaz in a flash and runs to the fence behind ",1680802256266
16.2," Suyash Sharma to Willey, , tossed up ball outside off, Willey gets underneath it and smashes it down the ground for a one-bounce boundary ",1680802338666
16.4," Suyash Sharma to Akash Deep, , where did that come from? What a hit from the No. 11! Tossed up ball outside off, Akash Deep skips down the track, converts it into a half-volley, and tonks it way back into the long-on stands ",1680802421089
17.4," Chakaravarthy to Akash Deep,  Caught&Bowled!! That's the final nail in the coffin! What a catch from Chakaravarthy to finish things off. He ends with a 4-fer, a night to remember! Tossed up ball outside off, Akash Deep looks to slog sweep it but ends up getting a top-edge. The ball skies to the mid-on region. Chakaravarthy and Gurbaz are after it. The former calls for it and takes an outstanding catch as he dives behind. ",1680802663838
