preview,"RCB were terrific against MI the other day as they kickstarted their campaign in style. Their pacers made the new ball talk, Karn Sharma played a crucial role in the absence of Hasaranga, and then the openers just blew the opposition bowling away. They will miss Reece Topley though after he injured his shoulder in that game. David Willey might replace him today.",1680785244402,66211
preview," Apart from Topley's absence, another challenge for RCB would be facing high-quality spin in the form of Sunil Narine and Varun Chakravarthy. The two openers, Faf du Plessis and Virat Kohli - who set off the fireworks in Bangalore - like pace on the ball. KKR might consider using spin against them early. Both Narine and Chakravarthy have good records against Kohli, while Umesh goes at 10.5rpo against him.",1680785669889,66211
preview,"Nitish Rana admitted that there was a lot to learn in KKR's opening defeat against PBKS. He went with his gut feeling and used just the five bowlers in that game, overlooking options like Andre Russell and Anukul Roy. He'll have to be at the top of his game today. And so will the batting lineup. KKR have signed Jason Roy as a replacement player with Shreyas Iyer and Shakib Al Hasan ruled out, but Roy won't be available in this game. So it's unlikely there's going to be any changes in the batting order after just one failure. David Wiese coming in for Tim Southee could be an option worth exploring though, with Lockie Ferguson still doubtful.",1680786120124,66211
preview,"The square boundaries are pretty short at the Eden Gardens - one of them being 58 meters, and the bigger one at 70 meters.

preview,Going to have a bowl. Bit of a misunderstanding with the accent there (confusion at the toss). Was dew last night. Hoping it will get skiddy in the second innings. That's a long way away.

This first month is all about making sure you get the process right and not get too ahead of yourself the second month is where it really counts and you need make sure all your guns blazing and have that constant energy through that second month which is always gonna help you cross the line. There's gonna be a lot of support for us, that's one great thing. The pitch, it looks very different to what it could be, so to see how it will behave - is it gonna turn, is it gonna have less bounce or is it gonna be the usual Eden Gardens wicket which obviously has a lot of runs in it.

There's number of guys that played a lot of T20 and IPL cricket, Nitish had an experience of captaining Delhi in domestic cricket here, so he is not an inexperienced captain. IN IPL, it is his first time, but he has done a great job so far. There's a couple of class players top of the order (for RCB) that played for a long time and when you play against guys for a long period of time they obviously know a bit about you and hopefully you know a little bit about them as well.

post," A night to remember for KKR whereas a night to forget for RCB! The momentum shift started from the 13th over, when Thakur came in and took charge. Before that, the hosts were in a precarious situation at 89/5. Thakur smashed 68 off 29 balls, and Rinku played a good hand as well alongwith a fine fifty from Gurbaz at the top of the order. KKR went back into the dressing room on a high. And sometimes, momentum matters a lot in a dynamic format like T20. Kohli and Faf did start decently but once the former was bamboozled by Narine, the procession started. The pitch did take turn and grip but the visitors will be disappointed with themselves as a lot of their players got out to poor shots. The KKR spinners took 9 out of the 10 wickets to fall, that tells you the story! Narine, Chakaravarthy, and the debutant, Suyash Sharma, had a great night. Not to forget, Lord Shardul Thakur - he was the one who turned the game on its head with a scintillating knock! RCB will be shell-shocked but they themselves have to blame for it.

post," A night to remember for KKR whereas a night to forget for RCB! The momentum shift started from the 13th over, when Thakur came in and took charge. Before that, the hosts were in a precarious situation at 89/5. Thakur smashed 68 off 29 balls, and Rinku played a good hand as well alongwith a fine fifty from Gurbaz at the top of the order. KKR went back into the dressing room on a high. And sometimes, momentum matters a lot in a dynamic format like T20. Kohli and Faf did start decently but once the former was bamboozled by Narine, the procession started. The pitch did take turn and grip but the visitors will be disappointed with themselves as a lot of their players got out to poor shots. The KKR spinners took 9 out of the 10 wickets to fall, that tells you the story! Narine, Chakaravarthy, and the debutant, Suyash Sharma, had a great night. Not to forget, Lord Shardul Thakur - he was the one who turned the game on its head with a scintillating knock! RCB will be shell-shocked but they themselves have to blame for it.

post," We had set it up nicely with the ball, probably at 100/5 around 13 overs, we kind of gave away 20-25 runs extra on that wicket. Shardul played incredibly well, he took the game away from us and KKR's leg-spinners bowled brilliantly. They got on top of us, with Narine and Chakaravarthy, they put the squeeze on us really well. Because that's the nature of leg spinners or mystery spinners. It was still a good wicket, our batting was very average and even when we lose games like these we need to ensure that we get close to the target, at least around 160 tonight. The game of T20 cricket moves so fast, we will try and learn our lessons, just making sure we tweak things we work on. It's fair to say tonight, it got a little bit away from us, tactically we could have been a little better. Death bowling is never the easiest jobs to do, Siraj and Harshal are quality bowlers at the death and just need to make sure, we work on our plans a little bit.",1680803460563,66211

post," It's a good win. The way boys have shown character looking at the initial stage after losing early wickets. Good sign that we bounced back to score 200-plus. We expected the pitch to help spinners but you need runs on the board. Have to congratulate Shardul Thakur and Rinku Singh for the way they batted. Varun bowled extremely well, even Sunny. And the newcomer provided support. We saw him in trial matches and were extremely happy with the way he bowled. He's quick through the air, difficult to pick. He's inexperienced but shows a very good attitude.",1680803475315,66211

post," In the previous match, there were a lot of positives. We were seven down but still we fought. Today we showed great fight. Gurbaz played a brilliant knock at the top of the order and Thakur changed the complexion of the game. Credit should also be given to Rinku as he played second fiddle to Thakur and paced his innings well. Umesh and Southee started decently with the ball. Then, our spinners bowled really well. Taking wickets regularly was great for us. Suyash is a confident young man and he has belief in himself. He made his chance count and it was great to see him bowl that way.",1680803721084,66211

post," I don't even know where it came from but looking at the scorecard at that time, everyone would have thought we are struggling. But your subconscious mind takes over. You also have to have skills to do that at the higher level, but we also work hard in the nets. There is a period where we can slog it in the nets. Coaching staff do the throwdowns, and give us the option of range-hitting. And you know the pitches - they always suit the batsmen, don't they? Suyash bowled exceptionally well, and we know the quality Sunil and Varun have. They have fun, take wickets. This was a perfect day.",1680804012948,66211
