preview," The defending champions, Gujarat Titans, host KKR for the first time today this season at the Narendra Modi Stadium in Ahmedabad. The 16th edition of IPL kicked off in style at this venue itself, with the home side notching up a fine victory against CSK in front of a jam-packed crowd. After that, GT travelled to Delhi and registered a clinical victory against the hosts  another prime example that they have all their bases covered. GT have only faced KKR only once before today and that was last year, with the Titans winning a tight contest.",1681029917280,66232
preview,"KKR, on the other hand, begun their campaign away from home with a loss in a rain-affected game against Punjab. However, they stood tall in their next game against RCB at Eden Gardens and stormed to a massive victory. The fact that Shardul Thakul pulled them out with the bat from a precarious situation shows the depth they possess. Consistency is what has eluded them in the past as well and that’s a big area to work upon. Can the Knights stop the march of the Titans? Or will the Titans make it a hat-trick of victories? Stick around as toss and team lineups are around the corner..",1681030229882,66232
preview," Their top-order trio of Gill, Saha, and Sudharsan has been solid! Miller is in cracking form. Their pace trio of Shami, Joseph, and Little is a force to reckon with and Rashid is on song too. The only chink in the armour perhaps is Hardik's form, especially with the bat but he has impressive numbers with the bat against KKR.",1681030821944,66232
preview," Gurbaz’s form at the top and with Roy available for KKR, it can definitely be a boon that doesn’t lead to any further experimentations with the opening combination. Thakur’s heroics with the bat last game. The spin twins, Narine and Chakaravarthy, have found another bright star in Suyash Sharma. However, only certain individuals have shone and that is a concern.",1681030862227,66232
preview,"It is a fresh pitch that is being used. On my right, it is 65m, on my left, 62m. Straight down the ground is 73m. In the one game that was played here, the spinners ruled the roost. Their economy rate was better. Rashid Khan, Mitchell Santner, and Ravindra Jadeja created some problems for the batters. This one though looks like a beautiful batting wicket. There is no patchy grass on this wicket. Spinners might have a bit of role to play but the quicks have a terrific opportunity as the pitch has a shine to it and even grass but it is a batting surface, reckon Matthew Hayden and Rohan Gavaskar in their ",1681031471105,66232
preview," The good thing about it was it was total team effort, the batters did well, the bowlers did well and hopefully we can carry the momentum in this game. (On Nitish Rana) I think we have some words bouncing off each other and he is a open captain so that is a great thing for him. (On adapting to bowling in modern-day cricket) Batters are playing shots which you didn’t even think about. So, you have to adapt, have to come up with different things, see what works, and see what doesn’t work and take it from there. I have basic plans and see wherever the game is going and which batter is doing what. Trying to simplify as much as possible to keep it on the easier side. It's all on the first over, watching from the first innings what is happening and then have a mindset. They are great opponents, they have won two games but if we are going to give a good showing, we will have an exciting game.",1681031471115,66232

preview," We would like to bat first, looks like a fresh wicket, hopefully we can put up a good total and defend it. (On Hardik Pandya not playing today) Just unwell slightly, don't want to take risks with him. As a team we will try to play good cricket. We would like to bat well and put runs on the board. Just one change,  is in for Hardik.",1681032629477,66232
preview, We wanted to bat first as well because of the weather and conditions. I felt defending might be easier. We had in our minds that batting first would be the way to go so that our spinners can make use of the surface in the second half but it's okay. We have two changes. comes in for Tim Southee and Mandeep Singh makes way for ,1681032754790,66232

preview," It is all about spending as much time in the middle as you can. It is more about having that intent to keep looking for the runs. More mental than technical. The game doesn't change even when you switch formats. All about fine-tuning your mind and getting a bit of practice under your belt. Understanding your role is also important, it is more about the situation you are in. Will depend on that. (On his plans for spinners like Sunil Narine) Don't think you can go in with a set mindset especially against one of the best spinners in the world. The strength of the side is that everyone contributes. It is just about doing the simple things and being consistent. You won't see one player doing all the work throughout the season. Each player contributes something.",1681033758520,66232

After Saha went for 17, the in-form Sai Sudharsan and Shubman Gill strung a partnership which was based on the latter's use of the feet against the spinners and the former's quick running. Gill holed out and after Manohar's cameo was ended by a fine googly, it was the turn of the two TN statemates to make an impact. Sudharsan reached his 2nd fifty in 2 matches and then it was the Shankar show. Especially the last two overs. Rana probably erred by not giving Varun his full quota and trusting Shardul over Umesh for the final over. But take nothing away from GT's batting and running which was superb throughout.

post," Don't tell me that actually happened. What an unbelievable finish to a game that was only just soaking up a hattrick from Rashid Khan a few overs ago. There was the blistering knock from Venkatesh Iyer too. But this moment, this game, this evening belongs to Rinku Singh who has left everyone stunned. He ran straightaway towards the dugout in celebration but was met halfway by his teammates who are all over him. And on the other hand there's Yash Dayal who's crestfallen. He had 29 to defend off the final over, and conceded a single off the first ball. What followed will go down as one of the greatest ever finishes to a T20 game.",1681048386062,66232

post," It's a tough game for us, especially for me as a captain. You need 30 plus in the last over, the same thing happened for us last year when we won. We will learn from it, more importantly a good game of cricket and the fans would have loved it. It was more about what he is most comfortable with, to trust his plans [on Yash Dayal's plans]. Rinku played unbelievable shots and credit goes to him for the way he played and for the way he finished. Keep it simple, hit the right area consistently and that's what T20 is all about. As a bowler I'm always trying to hit the right area. We got what we wanted. We wanted 190 and we got 200. As a bowling unit we got enough to defend, but sometimes in T20 even 250 does not look good. Take positives from this, it's still early in the competition and learn from it. Definitely not [on if this defeat will hurt morale]. Chin up and keep smiling and we come back stronger and stronger. It's good and something new is happening in T20, it makes you mature and I feel it's very good for the game of cricket [on the new rules]. For my future it's great, leading the team in IPL gives you lots of knowledge for the future. Good learning for me as a player and as a captain.",1681048851363,66232

post,"It was a nail-biting finish, extremely happy that we won the game. Our coach has always said that we can score 200 on any given day. Honestly, the wicket was quite good to bat and I was just trying to execute my plans. When the target is 200, you can't have silent overs. Me and Nitish had a good partnership. Unfortunately, somewhere we lost our way but Lord Rinku saved the day. To be honest, we still believed that we could win. This teaches us that we should never give up until the last ball. This will be a great morale-booster for us. We want to make winning a habit. I haven’t been in great form. Tonight, I went out and played as late as possible. The bowlers were quick and I tried to use their pace, and that worked to my advantage.",1681049118224,66232

post," We had a little belief. Rinku did something like this last year, although we didn't win that match. When the second six was struck, we started believing more because Yash Dayal wasn't executing that well. As a captain, it's important to have the belief. But this is a 1 in a 100 chance for something like this to happen. We were good with the ball except the last two overs. Same thing with the bat - that over from Rashid put us on the back foot. Credit goes to Rinku Singh. The two points we have from this game are thanks to him. People asked me why Rinku Singh doesn't get a bigger role, and always plays a small role. I want to say to those reporters if this is the second role, imagine what he can do with the first role. Last match he played a different role, and he did it well. To be honest, if I was batting and needed 30 off one over, the thought of having the belief would be there, but in your heart you know what you're capable of. I don't have words for him.",1681049118244,66232
