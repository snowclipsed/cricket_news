0.1," Khaleel Ahmed to Jaiswal, , Jaiswal starts off with a bang!! He got a first ball six against PBKS, this time a first ball four!! Short pitched and comes slow after hitting the deck, pulled through mid-wicket for a boundary... ",1680948057876
0.2," Khaleel Ahmed to Jaiswal, , shoddy fielding! This is short and rose steeply, Jaiswal does well to control his cut to the right of point. Mukesh Kumar is the man at third-man, misjudges the bounce and gifts a boundary... ",1680948085052
0.3," Khaleel Ahmed to Jaiswal, , a hat-trick of fours!! This is too full on off, Jaiswal opens the bat face on the drive to get it through extra cover for a boundary... ",1680948123430
0.5," Khaleel Ahmed to Jaiswal, , Yashasvi Jaiswal showing the full range here!! This is pitched up onto off, Jaiswal shuffles in and takes it under the bat to swing down the ground. Mid-on is too wide to have a say... ",1680948202093
0.6," Khaleel Ahmed to Jaiswal, , make that five!! Back of length with width, Jaiswal waits and expertly steers his cut over the short third fielder for a boundary.  ",1680948245970
1.3," Nortje to Buttler, , on a length but offered some width. Buttler frees his arms with the drive that goes between short cover and point. He's off the mark with a boundary as well... ",1680948435139
1.5," Nortje to Buttler, , full and quick outside off. Buttler had a slash and it takes a thick outside edge that flies over short third and into the boundary fence.  ",1680948503223
1.6," Nortje to Buttler, , another one! On a length on off, not too much wrong with the ball and Buttler just offers a gentle push that goes through extra cover and mid-off.  ",1680948566317
2.4," Mukesh Kumar to Buttler, , up and over. Slightly wider and fuller from Mukesh Kumar. Buttler isn't going to ignore this, slams it over wide mid-off for a boundary. One bounce and over... ",1680948810459
3.1," Khaleel Ahmed to Jaiswal, , new end, same treatment. Too wide and full from Khaleel Ahmed, Jaiswal drives it into the ground and over the point fielder for another boundary ",1680949003981
3.6," Khaleel Ahmed to Buttler, 2 runs, Put down!! This was another pitched up slower delivery, Buttler went for a big slog but didn't time it well. Got plenty of elevation and Nortje from mid-on kept running back. He got to the ball and had a juggle, but couldn't hold on. Always tough to catch these, but Buttler gets a life.. ",1680949390366
4.3," Axar to Jaiswal, , Jaiswal got ready early for the switch hit. Axar Patel saw that and fired it onto his boots. The batter gets an underedge that runs away to the third-man boundary ",1680949526627
4.4," Axar to Jaiswal, , superb shot!! This was flat on leg, Jaiswal backed away to play the cut and gets it between point and short third ",1680949566191
4.5," Axar to Jaiswal, , once again a hat-trick of fours!! This was fired in again, Jaiswal expected that, got low and swept it over square leg. A couple of bounces before going over... ",1680949595269
5.4," Nortje to Buttler, , yorker length, slightly underpitched and Buttler very easily lifts it over mid-off for a boundary. Makes cricket look so easy... ",1680949825692
6.4," Axar to Jaiswal, , goes on with the arm outside off, cut square of the wicket by Jaiswal and beats the dive of sweeper cover ",1680950213267
6.5," Axar to Jaiswal, , lovely shot!! Once again flat on the pads, not too much wrong with the delivery. Jaiswal stays back and pulls between deep mid-wicket and long-on.  ",1680950248214
7.2," Kuldeep Yadav to Buttler, , unlucky!! This was a very wide half tracker. Buttler goes chasing and gets an underedge that runs away to the third-man boundary. Nothing keeper or fielder could have done there ",1680950398641
7.4," Kuldeep Yadav to Jaiswal, , tossed up on leg, Jaiswal shuffled away and charged out to get under the ball. Hoists his drive over long-off and into the stands. Looked like a mishit on first viewing, but easily cleared the fence... ",1680950474214
7.6," Kuldeep Yadav to Buttler, , flat and was seam up onto the thigh pad. Buttler adjusts to pull it behind square and it races away to the fence again. RR almost at 100 and only 8 overs have been bowled... ",1680950536294
8.3," Mukesh Kumar to Jaiswal,  Caught&Bowled!! There comes the wicket! Very smart from Mukesh Kumar as he went for a surprise bouncer after seeing Jaiswal charge out. Bent his back on that and got the extra pace, hurried the southpaw who top-edged his pull only for an easy caught and bowled chance.  ",1680950835534
9.1," Kuldeep Yadav to Buttler, 2 runs, tossed up on the pads, turned to the right of long-on for a couple of runs. Smart running... ",1680951102832
9.5," Kuldeep Yadav to Samson,  Caught by Nortje!! A duck for Sanju Samson and the assist for this wicket goes to Mukesh Kumar. He tied up the RR captain with three dots, and Samson decided to heave it over long-on as Yadav flighted it up. Off to bottom of the bat and holes out to long-on. Not very smart from Sanju, DC can sense a route back now...  ",1680951265888
12.2," Axar to Buttler, , six after 25 deliveries!! Short on middle, Buttler goes back to pull it over cow corner and for a maximum. That's also his 50!! ",1680951841830
13.5," Powell to Riyan Parag,  Bowled!! Powell has broken through for DC - an ugly hoick from Parag, was looking to swing it over mid-wicket and missed it completely, another failure for him, but this will bring in Shimron Hetmyer - pace on this delivery from Powell, kept coming back with the angle and splattered into the stumps.  ",1680952322731
15.5," Mukesh Kumar to Buttler, , , a low full-toss from Kumar - Buttler gets down low and then paddles it over backward square leg, bounces away to the ropes in a hurry ",1680952927451
15.6," Mukesh Kumar to Buttler, , , very full and at the stumps, nothing wrong with the ball, but Buttler has backed away, opens up his arms and drives it like a sledgehammer, back past the umpire and giving long-on no chance,  ",1680952973164
16.3," Powell to Hetmyer, , Powell misses his length and is duly punished - length ball and Hetmyer smashes it back over the bowler's head, sails all the way over the ropes for a boundary ",1680953203480
16.4," Powell to Hetmyer, , , Powell has started to leak runs, full and wide of off, but Hetmyer can get under it and then drills the drive wide of extra-cover, long-off can't get across to cut it off ",1680953239699
17.3," Nortje to Buttler, , , funky moves from Buttler - shuffles across the stumps, used Nortje's pace and then lapped it very fine - long leg is square and has no chance ",1680953477149
17.6," Nortje to Buttler, , even Nortje is starting to travel, misses the yorker, turns out to be a low full-toss - Buttler didn't hit it cleanly, but mid-off was in the ring and the ball bounced over him to the ropes,  ",1680953581888
18.1," Mukesh Kumar to Hetmyer, , , on a good length and at the stumps, Mukesh missed the yorker and he's made to pay - Hetmyer gets under the shovel and sends it soaring over mid-wicket for a maximum ",1680953651178
18.3," Mukesh Kumar to Buttler,  Caught&Bowled!! That's a strange dismissal, but that'll please DC. Was a yorker length delivery at the stumps, Buttler jammed the bat down and squeezed it back at the bowler - Mukesh takes the catch and he's asking for a dismissal - he reckons that the ball came right back at him. Actually, it looks like he's chipped it back to the bowler, who has juggled once and taken it on the rebound. Replays in and it's clearly come off the toe-end, not sure Mukesh realised it either- threw the ball at the keeper and then turned around in a soft appeal.  ",1680953853447
18.4,"Mukesh Kumar to Dhruv Jurel, , , the slower ball from Mukesh, but it's right in the slot - Jurel shuffles across, picked the length and clears wide mid-wicket with a classy whip",1680953916263
19.1," Nortje to Hetmyer, , , back of a length and just outside off - Hetmyer shuffles across and then swings the arm around on the pull, sends it sailing - high and over mid-wicket for a maximum ",1680954046192
19.4," Nortje to Hetmyer, , , this ain't great bowling form Nortje - mid-off was inside the ring and he has a bowled a slower short ball, we outside off and it's carved away over the fielder, over the ropes for a maximum ",1680954165206
0.3," Boult to Prithvi Shaw,  Caught by Samson!! That's a corker from Samson and the impact substitute has been dismissed for a duck. Full and a hint of shape away from off - Shaw's feet went nowhere as he aimed at an expansive drive, gets a thick edge that flew to the keeper's right - it wasn't carrying to the lone slip, was wide of him as well, was travelling and Samson had to throw himself to his right, did so with his right mitss and the ball stuck, he did well to hold on even as he tumbled across.  ",1680955370067
0.4," Boult to Manish Pandey,  Lbw!! Two in two for Boult - Manish has been given  and he's decided to review, after a long chat with his captain. Oh dear! This doesn't look too good for the number 3, don't think there's an inside edge and UltraEdge confirms it Onto ball-tracking: The impact is in front of middle and it's crashing into the leg-stump - the on-field call will stay and DC have been rocked. A tragic start for the Capitals - the inswinger and Manish was attempting an ambitious on-drive, didn't account for the movement and fell across on the shot, loud shout and the umpire took his time before raising the finger.  ",1680955552354
1.5," Sandeep Sharma to Warner, , , that should bring some relief for Warner - fraction short and he's quick on the pull, swivels across and then places it wide of mid-wicket for a boundary ",1680955983950
2.1," Boult to Rossouw, , , back of a length and well wide of off, Rossouw's feet didn't go anywhere as he went chasing after it, sliced it in the air and to the left of Hetmyer at backward point ",1680956068586
2.3," Boult to Warner, , , short and wide of off, Warner gets on top of the bounce and crunches the cut past cover-point, no one moved as the ball raced away ",1680956135867
3.4," Ashwin to Warner, , . tad too short form Ashwin - Warner rocks back and then hammers the pull wide of mid-on. one bounce and over the ropes ",1680956389274
4.2," Holder to Warner, , , tad too full from Holder - Warner gets forward and then drives it over mid-off, bounces away to the ropes in a hurry ",1680956573386
4.6," Holder to Rossouw, , , width on offer and Rossouw throws his hands on the cut, carves it up and over backward point, one bounce and over the ropes -  ",1680956764523
5.4," Ashwin to Rossouw,  Caught by Jaiswal!! A soft soft dismissal for Rossouw - was way too early into the reverse sweep and scooped a simple catch to cover-point. Nice bit of flight and some extra bounce for the off-spinner - Rossouw was committed to the shot, but was a tad too early into it, lobbed in the air and Jaiswal completes the catch, diving forward. DC slipping away once again.  ",1680956934267
8.2," Boult to Lalit Yadav, 1 run, and another single down to third man as the batter went for a drive only to slice it down to the deep fielder ",1680957759542
8.3," Boult to Warner, , short ball and hammered! Was banged in short, Warner gets on top of the ball and pulls it hard behind square for a four. . His consistency has been second to none in this league ",1680957796853
8.5," Boult to Lalit Yadav, , short ball, outside off, Lalit Yadav goes back and slashes the ball past point for a four. That was timed and placed really well ",1680957866424
10.3," Chahal to Lalit Yadav, , and much needed! DC will take it with open arms. Lalit Yadav decided to go for the reverse sweep and managed to send it over the infield behind square on the off-side. Managed to get enough wood to a delivery lured up outside off ",1680958446679
10.4," Chahal to Lalit Yadav, , and four again! Gets another reverse hack and places it past point for a four. Was a fuller ball and Lalit Yadav managed to squeeze it into the gap. Big over so far ",1680958502511
11.1," Holder to Lalit Yadav, , what happened there? Was a very short ball, slower, Lalit Yadav manages to drag the pull and get it over the keeper as well as fine four a four. Was a poor delivery and Lalit Yadav somehow managed to put it away ",1680958677674
12.5," Boult to Lalit Yadav, , and drills it over mid-off for a four! Was a length delivery, Lalit Yadav backed away a little and got under the ball to pump it over mid-off. That sped away to the fence ",1680959128275
12.6," Boult to Lalit Yadav,  Bowled!! Full and straight and gone. That was right up there and Lalit Yadav went for an ugly hoick across the line to miss it. You miss and I hit comes true again. Lalit Yadav had to go for it and has to depart now. End of a good little knock from him but the team needed more from him. Boult ends with a three wicket haul. Another excellent game for him. He managed to do some damage with the new ball and now has come back to pick another one.  ",1680959161708
13.6,"Sandeep Sharma to Warner, , misses the yorker and Warner clips the ball away to deep mid for a four. That was hit away into the gap just past the dive from the man at mid-wicket",1680959504329
14.5," Chahal to Axar,  Stumped!! Was it a googly? The batter dances down and misses the line to be stumped. That infact was a tossed up delivery and turned in a little to beat the batter in flight. He never got to the pitch of the ball and that plotted his downfall. Fifth one down and DC will be hurt by his departure. The batter jumped out too soon I reckon.  ",1680959812027
15.1," Ashwin to Warner, , and gets that away for a four! Was a flatter one, Warner hung back and slammed it past deep cover.  His good run continues but he needs to improve his strike-rate. That has been a bone of contention for him ",1680959997947
15.3," Ashwin to Powell,  Caught by Hetmyer!! Dances down, the batter heaves it across the line and the man at deep mid takes it. The fielder misjudged it a little before recovering in time. Was very nicely doled up and the batter fell prey to the well floated up delivery. That should put the chase further into doldrums. Ashwin has managed to bargain another wicket.  ",1680960092611
17.6," Holder to Abishek Porel, , slower delivery, outside off, Abishek Porel gets under it and slams it over cover for a four. That was so well timed by Abishek Porel ",1680961158145
18.2," Chahal to Abishek Porel,  Caught by Hetmyer!! Looks to flog one across the line and finds the man at deep mid. Simple take indeed. Didn't connect well at all. Was well looped up and Abishek Porel just couldn't time it. That came off the inner half of the bat and went straight to the fielder in the deep.  ",1680961281187
18.6," Chahal to Warner,  Lbw!! And three reds! His troubles have ended as well. End of an indifferent knock from the southpaw. That was well tossed up, the batter was a little early into the reverse sweep and missed the line. He went for the review but in vain. That was dipping as well and hence Warner lost the review as well.  ",1680961499578
19.2," Sandeep Sharma to Nortje,  Bowled!! Slower delivery, Nortje looks to slog and misses. The ball shatters the wood work. 9th one down. Was a slower delivery, at the sticks, Nortje was too early into the slog on the on-side. He didn't read the disguise on the ball. Sandeep has had a game so far.  ",1680961630476
