preview, RR take on Delhi today. Both teams are coming on the back of losses. RR started off on an aggressive note in their first game. But they lost their last game against Punjab despite the heroics from Jurel and Hetmyer. DC on the other hand have spiralled to two losses. Their campaign was hit badly when Pant got ruled out before IPL 2023. And I guess they haven't been able to figure their best combination just yet.,1680944041842,66218
preview," I0$ The top 3, Chahal, Hetmyer and the latest sensation Jurel! Their bowling attack went for plenty in the last game but can be seen as an aberration.",1680944180488,66218
preview, Only an optimist might be able to point it out. Even the Warner fifty in the first game came at a sluggish pace. Axar Patel has been in good form and would be one man who might well have to bail DC out of the current big hole that they are in.,1680944634679,66218
preview,"The pitch that's been used today was used for the India-South Africa T20I where 450+ runs were scored. It's the centre pitch, 65m on both sides and longer straight boundaries. The pitch is brilliant, it might not be as good a wicket to bat on though, it's darker which means a bit more moisture, there are indentations and ridges which run parallel to each other because of the process of scarification, which has ensured a few marks. It's still a very good pitch to bat, but it might help the spinners to get some grip. batting first might be the way to go about today, reckons Deep Dasgupta, in his .",1680944812714,66218
preview," It was a quick turnaround, but felt quite good to be back and playing the game. We took our flight overnight so the time difference was ideal because I got to sleep on the flight. Unfortunate about how the last game panned out but was nice to get out there and be with the team again. The talk has been about doing the basics right and doing it for long periods, trying to partnerships up front with the bat, trying to build partnerships with the ball as well. Obviously the more wickets we can take the better, but also trying to restrict the opposition as much as we can and get some momentum going. (On powerplay bowling) Definitely important, we can build some sort of pressure, the more wickets we can get. It is a big focus for us.",1680944842676,66218
preview,I0$ KM Asif's role in the team has been to bowl with the new ball and chip in at the death. But he was very expensive in the last game. Barring that the experience in the bowling attack can make any team envious.,1680944852791,66218
preview,I0$ The list is too long. DC haven't had their batting and bowling department firing at all. They need a much improved performance today.,1680944990479,66218
preview,Our early bird Goks says - I0$,1680945535698,66218
preview,Another flat bed is expected to be doled out for today's game. Batters should be able to relish the 22 yards and the shorter fences. And there is enough artillery and ammunition we should see today as both sides boast of some of the biggest T20 mercenaries.,1680945690020,66218
preview,"As far as squads are concerned. Can't see RR making any changes. May be Asif might give way to Saini or may be Sandeep Sharma. Padikkal's position in the batting order is a little bit of a concern as well. And as for DC, can't fathom how many changes can they make to turn this around? I would leave it to you peeps to put on the selector's hat!",1680945823370,66218

preview, Don't know what's gonna happen. Hopefully we will start well. Marsh has gone home to get married. All the best to him. There is one forced change with Powell coming in for Marsh. There are changes. Lalit comes in as well for Sarfraz. Manish Pandey comes in.,1680946288747,66218
preview," I think it looks a good wicket to bat on. Should be a high scoring game. Let's see how we turn up. With the impact rule, we can balance the side both ways. We can kind of manage. Jos is alright. We have a couple of changes. I am a bit confused. I will have to see the sheet as it keeps changing thanks to the impact rule.",1680946368515,66218

19.6," The Royals have finished with a more than competitive score on the board, but this is the same pitch which saw India and South Africa plunder 450+ in a T20I not so long ago. You'd think they aren't out of the contest, especially with their fearsome batting line-up. It all started with Jaiswal launching into Khaleel, hitting him for 5 fours in the very first over. He was to race away to a 25-ball half-century and when he was finally dismissed, the Royals were already racing along. His dismissal and that of Samson meant that the Capitals found a way back and they did keep the scoring under check. At 130 for 3 after 15 overs, the Royals seemed to have wasted a great start, but Buttler and Hetmyer were in and they ensured that the final 5 overs did matter - 69 runs and the Royals have fallen just one shy of 200. Mukesh Kumar was the best bowler on view, cleverly mixing his lengths and his pace, but the others went for runs. Can DC chase down 200 and get their first points of #IPL2023?

This is a good wicket, so we need to bowl well to defend this. The powerplay was fantastic, but the bounce got lower as the ball got older and we lost some momentum in the middle-overs by losing a couple of wickets, hope Ashwin and Chahal could do the same for us. (On getting spin on early) It is a possibility, we’ve built a squad where everyone is comfortable bowling anywhere, so that’s an option but obviously Trent Boult has been bowling really well as well.",1680954630555,66218

19.6,"Sandeep Sharma to Kuldeep Yadav, 1 run, crouches low, goes for the sweep and finds the man at short fine. A single reduces the margin of defeat by one more run.  Meek capitulaton indeed. RR pick up another win and have got their campaign back on track after the little hiccups they had against the Punjab side in the last game",1680961826329,66218

post," DC have literally crawled to 142 in a chase of 200. The same story on loop for them ever since the start of the tourney. Warner once again snailed to a fifty and that at best has reduced the margin of defeat. Once Boult got two wickets in the first over, DC never looked like chasing this down. It seemed as if they were batting on a different track as compared to the RR side. Lalit Yadav and Warner tried to infuse some energy into the chase but failed to bridge the gap much as the rate required continued to grow. Once Lalit was dismissed, the formalities were left to be addressed. Earlier, Jaiswal and Buttler once again went bonkers to set it up for RR. They threatened to get more but settled for 199 after losing a few wickets in the middle overs. RR have picked up two wins now from three games and would be chuffed as well because they have given some facelift to their NRR as well.",1680961910601,66218

post," When you are chasing 200, you need to start well. Can't take the credit away from Trent Boult. He was really good. It is just about executing your skills. We had a couple of chop ons last evening. We are professionals. We need to work it out. It is frustrating to hit to the fielders. One of our strike bowlers went down as well. Just didn't go to plan.",1680961910611,66218

post," Almost everything went to plan. I think me not scoring runs didn't go plan (laughs). The way I play this format I take a few balls to settle in and then go out there and express myself. Those 40-50 runs at a quick rate with Jos going through with his business. My role in the team is very clear. Just got the feel I would take that kind of a catch. Last game when we played here, it was a swimming pool and we were not able to keep the ball dry. We will have to get used to wet balls. Yuzi and Ash bhai know how to do it with the wet ball. I think Ashwin is always looking at the batter. The ball being new was very crucial for us and Ash bhai got through two important overs.",1680961910621,66218

post," I have worked hard. Trying to express myself. Learning is important for me. Growing as a young player is important for me. In my mind, I was like if it is a loose ball I will hit it. I think everything I learn from Buttler. I try to see how he practises. I knew I can take on a few bowlers. I didn't know.

post,"RR would be delighted with the win. They hardly broke much sweat to clinch this. Early days in the tournament but they will be happy with the consistency that they have shown so far. DC will be sweating now. They look listless and clueless. They don't know which problem to fix. Warner, their skipper, has gotten two fifties and still looks out of place. The spin duo of Kuldeep and Axar also haven't been able to exert any kind of pressure. Nortje has been expensive and the list is endless. So, hop tabs and follow the El Clasico!",1680962605172,66218
