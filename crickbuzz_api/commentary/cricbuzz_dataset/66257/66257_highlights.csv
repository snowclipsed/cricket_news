0.1," Umesh Yadav to Harry Brook, , full and very wide, some swing as well. Harry Brook throws his bat on the drive and gets this through covers. Uppish but in the gap and races away for four.. ",1681480854358
0.4," Umesh Yadav to Harry Brook, , short of length, didn't have the menacing pace for a man who's grown up playing bowlers way quicker than this. Brook with an elegant pull in front of square, in the gap and four more... ",1681480978799
0.5," Umesh Yadav to Harry Brook, , cheeky!! This was full at the stumps, Brook shuffles in and ramps it to the right of short fine for a boundary. Shot of confidence, shot of a man who's buzzing after two early boundaries!! ",1681481035441
1.5," Ferguson to Harry Brook, , lovely!! Brook backs away and Ferguson goes full on off. The English batter with a lovely square drive for four. He's looking in the mood today ",1681481350191
2.5," Umesh Yadav to Harry Brook, , Brook backs away and Umesh Yadav tries the yorker on off again. Errs his length and bowls a low full toss and Harry Brook slams it over extra cover all the way into the stands. Just using the pace of the bowler ",1681481625693
2.6," Umesh Yadav to Harry Brook, , shot of the game!!  This was a length ball with a straight line, nothing wrong with the delivery. However, Brook backs away to make room and square cuts it into the stands over deep point. Superb batting here... ",1681481668582
4.1," Russell to Mayank,  Caught by Chakaravarthy!! Gone!! First ball wicket for Dre Russ. Why did KKR keep the ball away from him all this while? This was hitting the hard length on off, Agarwal backs away and tries to dab it past third but the fielder in the ring moves to his left and completes a fine catch.  ",1681482054417
4.2," Russell to Tripathi, , hits the hard length again but too straight. Gets some extra bounce as well to sit nicely on the shoulder for Rahul Tripathi to pull to the left of fine leg for a boundary... ",1681482148256
4.5," Russell to Tripathi, , low full toss on the boots, clipped to the right of mid-wickt and once it has gone past the infield it runs away for four!! ",1681482313619
4.6," Russell to Tripathi,  Caught by Gurbaz!!  Russell off on a celebratory run. This was the effort ball, banged in short and Tripathi top-edges his pull. Keeper Gurbaz runs forward and to his left to complete a fine pouch. The two West Indian veterans have turned the tide, first Narine with a three run over and now Russell with two wickets!  ",1681482370018
5.4," Chakaravarthy to Harry Brook, , short and wide, cut between point and covers. Could have and should have been stopped, but the fielder dives over the ball and that runs away for four... ",1681482615866
6.5," Russell to Markram, , that's more like it from the SRH skipper!! This was banged in short again, but Markram looked ready to pull it hansomely over deep square leg for a maximum ",1681482945340
9.2," Suyash Sharma to Harry Brook, no run, dropped!! This was a half tracker, Brook went back and slapped it hard straight back at the bowler. Didn't stick... ",1681483612490
9.6," Suyash Sharma to Markram, , tossed up on off, Markram decided he had to go for the big shot. Looked like a mistimed one but got enough meat behind his big drive to clear long-off. A very welcome six!! ",1681483739271
10.3,"Narine to Harry Brook, 1 run, flat outside off, Brook goes back to turn it towards deep mid-wicket. ",1681483840623
10.6," Narine to Markram, 1 run, flat delivery again, Markram off the backfoot turns it to long-on ",1681483950042
11.1," Suyash Sharma to Markram, , tossed up on off, Markram takes it on the bounces and heaves it over deep extra cover. All muscle on that one to clear the fence... ",1681484004690
11.3," Suyash Sharma to Markram, , out of here!! A bit of a half-tracker, and it spun in. Markram rocks back really quickly to pull it over deep mid-wicket. Superb hit, the speed with which he judged length was incredible... ",1681484063779
11.5," Suyash Sharma to Markram, , tossed up on middle, Markram decided early he was going to bring out the reverse and stuck to it. Over backward point and races away to the fence... ",1681484147578
12.3," Chakaravarthy to Markram, , short and pushed wider. Markram danced out and slapped this one hard to the left of long-off. A bit of ordinary fielding there from Umesh leads to a boundary ",1681484330678
12.4," Chakaravarthy to Markram, , take that!! What a way to get to fifty. Chakaravarthy goes quicker and on middle, right as per plan for Markram who clears his legs out the way and slogs it deep into the stands beyond deep mid-wicket!! ",1681484366135
12.5," Chakaravarthy to Markram,  Caught by Russell!! Fifty and out!! This was pitched up again, some gutsy bowling from Chakaravarthy. Markram couldn't resist the big slog once again, but gets more elevation than distance. Holes out towards cow corner where Russell takes a fine catch.  ",1681484419132
13.2," Suyash Sharma to Abhishek Sharma, 1 run, . Very casual from Shardul. Two chances down off Suyash Sharma's bowling. One put down by himself, now Shardul. Googly outside off stump, Abhishek goes for the loft and slices towards deep cover. Shardul attacks the catch, coulnd't control the momentum of the run and it burst through his hands ",1681484642991
14.1," Ferguson to Harry Brook, , my my my! Ferguson has a what have I done wrong here face! He bowled a slower ball, maybe it was in the slot, but Brook did pick this right out of the hands. Absolutely no signs of playing early. Brought the bat down in clean motion and through the line for a massive lofted drive over long-off. The shot of the day! ",1681484961514
14.2," Ferguson to Harry Brook, no run, good review from Brook. Immediate review and UltraEdge is flat. There was a definite sound, wonder where that came from. Slower delivery, Brook moved off-side to scoop, missed it completely and reverses the call with DRS ",1681485072874
14.3," Ferguson to Harry Brook, , full toss, yeah smash me ball. Mid-off in, Book says I got to do nothing fancy here and places the loft easily over mid-off for four more! ",1681485105994
14.4," Ferguson to Harry Brook, , , another full toss, this time pace off but doesn't matter as Brook slices it past point for four more. This is really poor bowling from such an experienced campaigner ",1681485176743
14.4," Ferguson to Harry Brook, , brilliant! Absolutely brilliant from Brook. Deft touch too. Slower delivery, Brook moved across, but he ensured he met the ball gently to ensure it splits keeper and short fine leg to perfection ",1681485185527
14.6," Ferguson to Harry Brook, , what an over! Short and wide, no one at third man, hit me ball and Brook cuts it easily for four. 23 off that over. SRH are motoring along nicely ",1681485269161
15.3," Suyash Sharma to Harry Brook, , that could have been another caught and bowled, but Suyash Sharma thought I am not risking losing my fingers. Powered hard down the ground off the back foot, ump got out of sight quickly, bowler stood unmoved ",1681485447807
15.5," Suyash Sharma to Abhishek Sharma, , sliced away nicely, beats backward point, tease for the fielder in the deep and he loses despite the dive ",1681485516457
15.6," Suyash Sharma to Abhishek Sharma, , googly, Abhishek advances and lofts the drive over extra-cover. Picked that out of the hands and easily hit that. 15-run over. SRH on course for 210+ ",1681485552849
16.2," Narine to Abhishek Sharma, , short and wide, cut away past backward point and that bad ball has been punished ",1681485648686
16.5," Narine to Harry Brook, 1 run, dragged to long-on carefully ",1681485729171
16.6," Narine to Abhishek Sharma, , goes full and straight for the first time to Abhishek in this over and it's a lofted drive way over long-on. What a finish, spoils Narine's figures a bit ",1681485770958
17.4," Chakaravarthy to Abhishek Sharma, , slot ball, at pace, front leg out of the way and baang, over long-on. Clean swing of the bat from Abhishek ",1681485965867
17.6," Chakaravarthy to Harry Brook, , I am afraid he will hit me down the ground, so let me not offer anything in the slot kind of ball from Chakaravarthy, but he drops it way too short for Brook to have an easy pull shot through square leg, splitting the fielders in the deep. Into the 90s. Enough time for a hundred now ",1681486025547
18.1," Russell to Abhishek Sharma,  Caught by Thakur!! In the airrrr, taken at long-on. Oh hang on, Russell is down on the ground in pain. Looks like cramps. Short of a length delivery, Abhishek looks to loft, toe-ends it high and Shardul judges it nicely this time. Hope it's nothing serious with Dre Russ.  ",1681486188339
18.3," Thakur to Harry Brook, , this is outstanding batting! Not a bad ball at all. Round the wicket yorker, Brook makes room and opens the bat face nicely to split point and cover-point. Top shot from Brook ",1681486469470
18.5," Thakur to Klaasen, , top edge and over the keeper. Short of a length delivery, Klaasen slogs, gets a thick edge and gets four more for SRH. Can't do much about this as a bowler ",1681486568395
18.6," Thakur to Klaasen, , low full toss, Klaasen flicks, tease for deep deep square leg, he runs and stretches his hand, loses the race ",1681486606635
19.3,"Umesh Yadav to Harry Brook, 1 run, slapped to long-on and that is a  hundred. Tests, ODIs, T20Is, IPL. Put him anywhere he will score! What a talent. He gets the first hundred of the season for us. Slower delivery, hit down the ground, call for two but there was no second. SRH dugout absolutely happy. Even the Eden Gardens crowd applauds. Takes the helmet off, soaks up the applause",1681486788999
19.5," Umesh Yadav to Klaasen, , full toss, Klaasen hits down the ground, wasn't middled but he manages to hit over the rope ",1681486868086
0.3," Bhuvneshwar to Gurbaz,  Caught by Umran Malik!! Hack, a proper hack and he gets an outside edge to third man. Inswinger from Bhuvneshwar. Gurbaz got tricked into a playing across the line slightly, maybe he should have just lofted that over cover. Almost a leading edge that because he swun across the, thick edge and Umran tracks it down nicely for a comfortable catch at third man. Not the start KKR wanted.  ",1681487985368
2.1," Bhuvneshwar to N Jagadeesan, , in the airrrr, just out of Tripathi's dive at backward point.Good length delivery, Jagadeesan outside edges the drive, Tripathi full length to the right but it just escaped him ",1681488500369
2.3," Bhuvneshwar to N Jagadeesan, 1 run, . Good length delivery outside off stump, Jagadeesan hits it straight back to the bowler, Bhuvneshwar wasn't expecting and he didn't have enough time to be honest ",1681488580445
2.4," Bhuvneshwar to Venkatesh Iyer, , mishit, but Venky will take it. Looked like the slower ball, the knuckle ball, yes! Venky goes for the loft and plays a tad early, luckily the timing was good enough to clear mid-off ",1681488643335
3.1," Marco Jansen to Venkatesh Iyer, , the first real well timed shot from Venkatesh. Slower delivery, was picked from the hand so Venkatesh delayed the shot to power it nicely over the bowler's head for four ",1681488766043
3.2," Marco Jansen to Venkatesh Iyer,  Caught by Markram!! Soft dismissal. Hit me ball down leg, Venkatesh checks his flick shot, leading edge high and a dolly for mid-on. So the impact sub not really working for KKR. SRH bossing this game.  ",1681488828623
3.3," Marco Jansen to Narine,  Caught by Markram!! This is such smart bowling from Marco Jansen. 1. cramp the batters for room. 2. Also don't bowl slot.  now. KKR sent Narine up for some pinch hitting. Narine wants to go down the ground immediately and totally miscues it to mid-on. On a batting beauty to be 20/3 in the 4th over, well, can't be doing that.  ",1681488940692
4.1," T Natarajan to N Jagadeesan, , Jaggi opens up straightaway on arrival of his Tamil Nadu teammate Nattu. Front leg out of the way and slogged to deep mid-wicket, although not properly middled ",1681489189771
4.6," T Natarajan to N Jagadeesan, , ah shot! Good length delivery, Jagadeesan goes down the ground and lofts it high over long-on. Jaggi started to middle them better now ",1681489369275
5.1," Umran Malik to Nitish Rana, , and he starts off with a first ball bouncer. Short delivery, Nitish pulls, totally rushed on the shot. Very lucky that the top edge cleared short fine leg. Umran will try again ",1681489460444
5.2," Umran Malik to Nitish Rana, , oh, this is interesting! Rana is taking on the short ball. This wasn't all that short, Rana stood tall and smashed the pull, landed right on the cushion. This is getting spicy out there ",1681489507082
5.3," Umran Malik to Nitish Rana, , Rana has decided I am going to try and put the pressure back on Umran knowing he's going to come hard at him. But Umran for some reason ran in and dished out a slot ball, dragged to deep mid-wicket. Rinku is smiling and clapping. Shouts of ""KKR, KKR,"" pick up ",1681489567524
5.4," Umran Malik to Nitish Rana, , four more! Markram surely's got to go and have a word with Umran. Pace is alright, but the length and direction is way too off. Short and wide with no off-side defence in the deep, Rana says thank you very much and smashes the cut shot over cover-point ",1681489617959
5.5," Umran Malik to Nitish Rana, , top edgeeee, where is fine leg? How do you not have a fine leg if you are going to bowl short and this guy bowls quick for the edge to travel anyway! Short again, Rana doesn't stop himself from hacking, gets lucky with the edge as it clears short fine leg ",1681489672163
5.6," Umran Malik to Nitish Rana, , what an outstanding shot! Rana expects short stuff, Umran Malik delivers, Rana stays back and cuts this away over backward point for a brilliant six. 28 off that over and SRH have needlessly got KKR back into the game with this poor over ",1681489787921
6.1," Markande to N Jagadeesan, , sliced away nicely, past short third man and four more. Runs just flowing ",1681489835275
6.4," Markande to N Jagadeesan, 2 runs, . What are SRH doing? Tripathi the culprit. Jagadeesan plays the slog-sweep, top edges this to deep mid-wicket. Tripathi runs in, gets both hands and spills it ",1681489923468
6.5," Markande to N Jagadeesan, , oh what a shot! Was on the front foot, had to delay because of extra turn and flight from Markande, Jagadeesan opened the bat face last second, tease for short third man and it beats the dive ",1681489955926
7.4," Washington Sundar to N Jagadeesan, , 102.8kph, length ball sliding away outside off as Washington stays round the wicket to Jagadeesan as well. This isn't all that short. But Jagadeesan backs away, makes room and slaps it through backward point ",1681490186211
8.2,"Markande to N Jagadeesan,  Caught by (sub)Glenn Phillips!! There's some air on this leg-break, and Jagadeesan's eyes light up. He gets down low, hits the slog-sweep and holes out at deep midwicket! Struck it quite well, but just didn't get much elevation. It goes flat to the left of Phillips, the sub fielder, at deep midwicket. And he judges it well. Markande, who should've had him in his first over, gets him eventually. ",1681490336809
9.6," Marco Jansen to Nitish Rana, ,  137kph, length ball around off, and Rana nails the cross-batted swipe over long-on ",1681491006637
10.1," Markande to Russell,  Caught by Marco Jansen!! Again Russell falls early to a legspinner.  Flat legbreak around leg, Russell wants to swing it down the ground but the length isn't in his half. The ball grips and holds, Russell skies it up, goes many a mile in the air, and Jansen takes such a composed catch coming in from long-on.  ",1681491081318
11.1," Washington Sundar to Rinku Singh, 1 run, 98.2kph, length ball sliding into the pads, Rinku looks to clip it away but it goes off an inside edge to short fine ",1681491335224
11.2," Washington Sundar to Nitish Rana, , right in the slot for Rana! 100.2kph, fired in full around off, Rana gets forward and hammers it straight back ",1681491358249
11.3," Washington Sundar to Nitish Rana, 2 runs, 101.3kph, full delivery drifting into off, Rana gets forward and pushes through extra cover for two!  ",1681491389098
12.2," Markande to Nitish Rana, , ah that's too full, and Rana is hitting it too well to miss out! Floated up on off, doesn't matter which way it's turning because it's so full, and Rana lofts it for a big six ",1681491550955
13.4," T Natarajan to Rinku Singh, , ah there we go again! Rinku Singh clearing the boundary! Full in the slot around off, Rinku clears the front leg and hammers it over long-on. It goes way back in the stands ",1681491867747
13.6," T Natarajan to Nitish Rana, , makes room to drive through extra cover. Instead it goes running away off a thick inside edge through square leg. Natarajan can only stand with his hands on hips. He did well to follow Rana with a full delivery, inducing the error, but it still finds the ropes ",1681491998646
14.2," Bhuvneshwar to Rinku Singh, no run,  Massive moment in this game! It's a very full delivery around middle, Rinku swings across the line, he's early through the shot and it takes the toe-end. But it bounces straight into the pitch before going to the keeper. The decision will be reversed, much to the delight of the crowd ",1681492233309
14.3," Bhuvneshwar to Rinku Singh, , low full toss on the pads, Rinku flicks it nicely and gets it away past short fine! ",1681492257844
15.3," Marco Jansen to Nitish Rana, , ah that's a harsh call from the umpire. Slower one angled in, Rana moves across the stumps, looks to sweep and misses. It only just misses leg stump. No surprise that SRH have gone for a review against the wide call. Now this is interesting, the third umpire upholds the decision, despite the fact that Rana clearly stepped across the stumps. Had he stayed in his original stance, it would've easily hit him on the pad ",1681492564970
15.4," Marco Jansen to Nitish Rana, 1 run,  Some of the catching tonight has been really poor! It's Washington Sundar this time who fails to hold on. Slower bouncer, Rana looks to pull, skies it off a thick top-edge. It goes very high and Washington has a lot of time to settle under it. But he puts it down ",1681492686864
15.6," Marco Jansen to Rinku Singh, , , full toss on the pads,  He swings hard and whacks it over square leg. And to make things worse, it's a no ball ",1681492801064
15.6," Marco Jansen to Rinku Singh, , another six! Another six from Rinku Singh, his third of the night! Slower one outside off, Jansen tries to keep it out of his reach, but Rinku is still able to get to it. He reaches out and clobbers it over extra cover. Here we go again ",1681492843074
16.2," T Natarajan to Nitish Rana, , Natarajan misses the yorker, offers a full toss and gets hammered down the ground! Rana with a clean swing of the blade sends it sailing into the crowd ",1681493085004
16.3," T Natarajan to Nitish Rana,  Caught by Washington Sundar!! Full toss again, but Rana hits it straight to hand this time! Line is outside off, he goes hard at it and smashes it to sweeper cover. No mistake from Washington this time. Oh Nitish Rana. He played so well, and has got out to such a hittable delivery.  ",1681493137616
16.6," T Natarajan to Thakur, , ! Low full toss down leg, Thakur only has to get some bat and it runs away past short fine leg ",1681493304350
17.2," Bhuvneshwar to Thakur, ,  Slower length ball, Thakur swings hard, gets deceived by the lack of pace but gets four anyway ",1681493448855
17.6," Bhuvneshwar to Thakur, 2 runs,  Slower leg-cutter outside off, Thakur swings hard, and slices it in the air over extra cover. Markram has to run back from the circle as he goes after it. Would it have been easier for the converging fielder running in from the ropes? But Markram calls for it, puts in a diving effort but puts it down ",1681493602295
18.2," T Natarajan to Rinku Singh, , another attempted wide yorker, turns out to be a low full toss and Rinku hammers it through backward point. It races away to the ropes ",1681493727382
18.5," T Natarajan to Rinku Singh, , oh that's not a bad ball. Goes for a yorker on middle, gets it very full to stop Rinku from getting under it. But Rinku powerfully swipes it through midwicket for four ",1681493854197
18.6," T Natarajan to Rinku Singh, , dropped! Glenn Phillips has dropped a sitter! Short of length around the waist, Rinku mistimes the pull in the air, should've been swallowed at deep midwicket. But Phillips, one of the best on the outfield, makes a mess of it.  ",1681493909578
19.1," Umran Malik to Thakur,  Caught by Washington Sundar!! That should be the game for SRH! They now need 32 off 5, even RInku Singh can't do much about that. Slower length ball outside off, Thakur looks to slog and gets a thick edge. Comfortably taken at backward point.  ",1681494017805
19.5," Umran Malik to Rinku Singh, , Rinku can't stop hitting sixes in the final over. It's off the top-edge, and goes flying over fine leg. Back of a length outside off, Rinku has a massive heave and Umran's pace takes it over ",1681494249790
