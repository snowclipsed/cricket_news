preview," It is Kolkata versus Hyderabad today, and the winner gets the crown for the best biryani. Nope, just kidding… That’s a debate that’ll rage on for eternity, but one debate that will surely be settled tonight is who gets the two points. And those could be two valuable points to gain some winning momentum as the games arrive thick and fast in the IPL.",1681477303246,66257
preview,"First to the hosts, who would be on cloud nine after that extra terrestrial last over performance by Rinku Singh in their previous game. Despite missing their skipper Shreyas Iyer and having a misfiring Andre Russell, KKR would be very pleased with the performance of their Indian core. Venkatesh Iyer, Nitish Rana and Rinku Singh were the heroes in their previous game, and add to that the explosiveness of Rahmanullah Gurbaz and possibly Jason Roy up top, Kolkata are really building a solid team. They also have the spin attack for their home venue, with two mystery spinners who continue to trick opposition batters, and Suyash Sharma being a handy auxiliary option.",1681477556903,66257
preview,"Sunrisers Hyderabad didn’t just lose their first two games, but lost them in a demoralizing fashion. They however responded well with a clinical performance and win against PBKS on their home turf. The return of Aiden Markram and Marco Jansen has greatly strengthened the team in Orange, and they’d hope to build on that momentum with another good performance today. The good news for them is Rahul Tripathi is back amongst the runs again, while Bhuvi Kumar is swinging the new ball and Nattu is nailing the yorkers. We’re just a few moments away from the toss, stick around for more updates…",1681477643970,66257
preview,"The weather is a little bit muggy, so the comfort levels of players are going to be tested. In terms of ground dimensions, it is a 75m straight boundary, but the square boundaries are shorter at 64m and 65m. That means a lot of sixes, says . The pitch has taken me by surprise. Last game against RCB it was all about the spinners so I thought we would see a shaven pitch with a lot of grass but this pitch is hard and it will hold true. Someone like Umran Malik might enjoy this, and the rest of the pacers who could get good bounce on this wicket. But don’t ball short on this wicket, because the side boundaries are really short. I had a piece prepared for the pitch report for spin, butB2$ You can expect a lot of runs, a batter won’t be too worried looking at this wicket, says ",1681478127802,66257
preview,"Body feels good, nice to have a run around in Ahmedabad. Had a hamstring issue coming into the competition, but now it feels okay. It is all about execution in T20s, if you can nail your yorkers and nail the slower balls and commit to them then you can come out on top. Planning is tough because every bowler bowls differently, we look at the strengths and weaknesses of the opposition to work out how things are going to be. (On win against GT) It was a great game, but we need to stay consistent throughout the comp. I’m sure it will be an exciting game today as well.",1681478685878,66257
preview," I feel I'm bowling alright, but not getting many wickets. So while I'm economical in powerplay, it'll be great if I can pick up one or two wickets up front. That's what the team expects from me. And that's what I did last year. Not everyone is going to fire in the same game. Main thing is that if 2-3 players are having a good day, they should finish the game. I wasn't trying to get a single on that ball. My effort was to hit a six or four. But that was Rinku's day. It was meant to be.",1681478805941,66257
preview,"Happy that I got to contribute in the last game, would like to repeat the same process. Good to get runs under my belt. Today is a different venue, different opposition so it is a new challenge. I played the situation better in the last game, the first quick I was out too quick, the second game there was a difficult wicket but the other day our bowlers did well so the target was always in our sight. T20 is about taking those risks, and putting the bowler under pressure.",1681479017079,66257

Hopefully we can do well. One change,  I don't think we'll set a target, you need to look at the pitch and then reassess. Whatever we get we'll try our best to defend.",1681479079190,66257

He had a poor run this far playing on pitches that weren't really batter friendly, but he saw a belter of a wicket here, small boundaries too and pounced on it. KKR came with some really poor new ball bowling. But spin brought them back as Brook shut shop. Dre Russ, who hadn't bowl thus far this season, came on and struck first ball and last ball of his first over. With Brook taking a defensive approach to spin, Markram took the onus to attack and he attacked like a boss. Outscored Brook for his fifty despite the start the English youngster got. That innings was key to Brook playing through. And once pace was on in the form of Ferguson, Brook upped his gears and it didn't matter who bowled at the end as he got his hundred.

post," It wasn't to be for Rinku Singh tonight. The sixes still flowed from him, but it was well out of reach in the final over by the time he got on strike. It's a wonder KKR even got so close from where they were at the start of the chase. Bhuvneshwar and Jansen rattled them with the new ball as they slipped to 20/3. But a stunning counter-attack from Rana, which started with taking Umran Malik to the cleaners, and a late assault from Rinku, who else, got the crowd's hopes up. But the death bowling today was a lot better. Bhuvneshwar came back to bowl a terrific 15th and 18th over. Natarajan wasn't on the money the whole time, but he was good enough. And Umran closed it off after the early damage he took. Not to forget Mayank Markande's lovely spell through the middle as .",1681494379781,66257

post," Thanks for the compliments on the run chase. I feel the way we bowled was not according to the plans. No matter what the wicket was like, this wasn’t a 230 wicket. One odd day you’ll get an innings like Rinku had the other day, but not everyday. We batted really well, we wanted to take the game deep and then you never know. Home advantage is one thing, but we know Eden Gardens tracks always play this way, we expected 200 to be a par score here and have been preparing that way, but we need to bowl better. Today, even the main bowlers were going for runs but I can’t be too critical because these are the same bowlers who will win me a game some other time. Very happy with the fight we showed but would have loved it more if we got two points as well.",1681494873668,66257

post," We just wanted to get wickets up front, but the way they scored in the 6th over, they were equal to us (powerplay score). I am not a big fan of too many slower balls or variations. You just got to bowl in the right areas. Try to bowl according to the batter and the dimensions. Just wanted to back him (Umran for the final over) and he started the over with two good balls. (Pitch) Bad for bowlers for sure (chuckles). No, really good wicket for the batters. They can come hard and if you put the ball in the right areas you can get wickets as well. Top class innings (from Harry Brook), we needed that type of an innings from him. Having him among the runs is a big plus for us. He can take any team apart, that is why the management sent him to open the batting.",1681495168346,66257

post," Feels good winning away from home. Was always going to be a tight game. With their firepower we knew the total wasn't safe. Our bowlers showed character. I was fortunate that we got off to a great start. Makes life easier. We bat quite deep so you get the freedom. We all know Harry - his ability we have seen. Giving a player like that the time to face a lot of balls. He's Mr. Reliable for sure (Bhuvi). Certainly helps the dressing room. It's a great bunch of guys. It's cricket at the end of the day, always going to teach you a lesson.",1681495415628,66257

post, Was a special night. Thankfully we got over the line as well. Got a little tense in the middle. A lot of people say that opening the batting in T20 is the best time to bat. I'm happy to bat anywhere. I've had a lot of success batting at five. Made my name there. My four Test hundreds will have to be over this one. The crowd was phenomenal tonight. I enjoyed it. I was putting pressure on myself a little bit. You go on social media and people are calling you rubbish. There's a lot of Indian fans out there who'll say well done tonight. But they were slagging me off a few days ago. Glad I could shut them up to be honest.,1681495582962,66257

post,"Phew, we've had another cracking game! It saw 433 runs scored overall, a hundred from Harry Brook after three failures to start, a superb innings from Markram who took the spinners on when Brook was unable to, and then two blazing fifties from Nitish Rana and Rinku Singh to keep KKR in the hunt chasing 229. But it was probably Bhuvneshwar Kumar and Mayank Markande who made the difference with the ball. So that's a wrap from us here as SRH bounce back after their poor start to the season to win two in a row. Hope you enjoyed our coverage. This is Sagar Chawla signing off on behalf of Praveen, MS Ramakrishnan and Saurabh Shankar. Goodbye!",1681495779657,66257
