0.1,"Bhuvneshwar to Prabhsimran,  Lbw!! On the money straightaway! 127.6kph, seam-up ball that jags back in a bit off the deck from a short of a good length. Prabhsimran is rooted in his crease and doesn't account for the inward movement as he looks to defend. Beaten on the inside edge and struck on the back leg adjacent to the sticks. The umpire's finger went up quickly and Prabhsimran didn't review it. Ball-tracking shows it to be clipping top of middle (umpire's call). Perfect start for Bhuvneshwar and SRH! ",1681048853110
0.5," Bhuvneshwar to Dhawan, , 131.1kph, fullish delivery swinging away, Dhawan skips down the track and push-drives in the direction of the swing. Beats the diving backward point fielder to his left ",1681049134556
1.2,"Marco Jansen to Short,  Lbw!! LBW appeal, umpire Bruce Oxenford raises his finger! Short has a word with his batting partner - Dhawan - and decides not to review. Only an inside edge could have saved him here. , full and swinging in, Short stays in his crease and tries to play an expansive drive. He didn't expect the ball to come in so much. Beaten comprehensively on the inside edge and he's pinned on the back leg adjacent to the sticks. That's plumb! ",1681049356878
1.3," Marco Jansen to Jitesh Sharma, no run, now, Jitesh Sharma has been adjudged lbw. Another inswinger, beats the batter's inside edge to rap him on the front pad as he looks to work it into the on-side. He was walking forward as well. No bat. Over to ball-tracking and it's swinging down leg. Successful review! ",1681049526915
1.4," Marco Jansen to Jitesh Sharma, , no swing, fullish and angled across, Jitesh Sharma throws his bat for a drive sans any feet movement. Gets a thick outside edge and the ball eludes first slip to his right before running away to third man for four ",1681049558323
2.4," Bhuvneshwar to Dhawan, , 131.1kph, Bhuvneshwar goes fuller and wider, no movement and Dhawan pushes it straight of mid-off. Yes, just a push but the timing was spot-on ",1681049782688
2.6," Bhuvneshwar to Dhawan, , aerial and four! Dhawan comes down the track, negates any movement and opens his bat-face to drive it up and over the covers ",1681049868726
3.5,"Marco Jansen to Jitesh Sharma,  Caught by Markram!! Straight to mid-off! , length ball, Jitesh Sharma neither gets the required elevation nor does he get the placement right. Plays an uppish drive and it's catching practice for Markram at mid-off. After four dots, Jitesh was forced to take a risk and he perishes. ",1681050055372
4.4," T Natarajan to Dhawan, , 130.4kph, fullish delivery with a bit of away swing, Dhawan slices the drive and the ball falls short of the backward point fielder. Washington Sundar got a hand on it but the ball still had the legs to reach the fence. The ball actually spun away and hence the fielder couldn't stop it ",1681050375181
5.1," Marco Jansen to Sam Curran, , wow! 135.2kph, short of length delivery marginally outside off, Sam Curran stands tall and slams it over long-on for a 92m six. Stand and deliver ",1681050535705
5.2," Marco Jansen to Sam Curran, , four more! Shaping away outside off on a good length, Sam Curran throws his arms at it to flay it up and over the covers. Too wide and Curran pounced! ",1681050573433
6.1," Washington Sundar to Sam Curran, , 92.5kph, Sam Curran greets Washington Sundar with a boundary. Shortish ball spinning away outside off, Curran rocks back quickly and slaps the cut through extra cover ",1681050882413

7.5," T Natarajan to Dhawan, , fabulous late-cut. A back of a length delivery just outside off, Dhawan delays the cut and sends it to the left of backward point, races away ",1681051271181
8.3," Markande to Sam Curran, , Sam Curran is looking to be positive, this skids on outside off, fraction short and Curran cuts between two fielders at backward point ",1681051447699
8.5," Markande to Sam Curran,  Caught by Bhuvneshwar!! Superbly bowled, deceived Sam Curran who was charging down, bowled it slower and wider outside off, the googly as well, Curran swipes across the line and the thick outside-edge loops to short third man.  ",1681051506468
9.5," Umran Malik to Raza,  Caught by Mayank!! Disappointing end for Raza once again. Did he not know that third man was fine? Good short ball, angling into Raza and always following him, Raza arches back and ramps it, but does not get the elevation to clear Mayank. The Impact sub too goes cheaply and SRH well on top.  ",1681052023147
9.6," Umran Malik to Shahrukh Khan, , wow! 150.4kph short of length delivery heading to off and SRK has punched this after standing tall wide of mid-off. Talk about meeting fire with fire ",1681052138021
10.4," Markande to Shahrukh Khan,  Lbw!! SRK is plumb LBW here but takes the review. He has a word with Dhawan and the skipper signals. What a lovely googly and SRK has no clue, the bat is miles from the ball as it comes down for the forward defence, the ball raps the pads and you don't get plumber LBWs than that. Hang on - it is just ump's call on clipping leg-stump, but that will do. The review is not lost as well. The googly spun and to the naked eye it looked to be crashing into the stumps.  ",1681052375779
11.2," Umran Malik to Harpreet Brar,  Bowled!! Knocked him over. 148kph length delivery angling into off and middle, zips off the deck, right through the forward defence of Harpreet Brar who left a tiny gap for the ball to burst through. Umran Malik punches the air in his trademark celebration.  ",1681052636576
11.3," Umran Malik to Rahul Chahar, no run,  Umran does not know it, umpire Bruce Oxenford mentions that to him. 148.5kph, rocket but full down leg, Rahul Chahar shuffles across and flicks, so , UltraEdge picks up the spike. No wonder Umran was so excited ",1681052779450
11.6," Umran Malik to Rahul Chahar, no run, down leg, short of length and Rahul Chahar shuffles across slightly to pull, misses, close to the bat and glove, ump shakes his head as Chahar looks for the wide. Dhawan reviews. They check for a caught behind first and then the third ump feels that Chahar has moved, so no wide.  ",1681053050647
12.5," Markande to Rahul Chahar,  Lbw!! Another ump's call - this time on impact and Rahul Chahar has to go. Fair call from umpire Ulhas Gandhe to give that out. The tossed up googly outside off, Chahar goes for a big slogsweep without picking it, misses, is hit on the back leg, the ump thinks it's out and the review shows ball-tracking to be ump's call on impact on off-stump and crashing into the stumps. PBKS sinking badly.  ",1681053230146
13.1," Umran Malik to Dhawan, , 147.3kph, short of length delivery outside off and it went off the bat even faster. Dhawan slashes the cut and sends it to the third man fence ",1681053396818
14.4," Markande to Dhawan, , tossed up and Dhawan shimmies down the track to loft, was the googly but he got to the pitch and slammed it straight down the ground ",1681053714608
14.6," Markande to Nathan Ellis,  Bowled!! What a daft shot. Dhawan must be livid. What was Nathan Ellis trying to do there. Last ball of Markande's spell and Ellis tries a fancy reverse-sweep to a googly, misses and the ball turns in to hit off and middle. Markande finishes with a four-fer.  ",1681053775531
15.4," T Natarajan to Dhawan, ,  But he has been the lone man standing. A slower ball off-cutter outside off, slugged meatily into the crowd at deep mid-wicket ",1681053995730

17.2,"Umran Malik to Dhawan, , six more. It's short of length outside off, Dhawan pulls and the top-edge carries to Bhuvi at fine-leg who does not judge it well, , his momentum was taking him over, the ball falls out of the hands and outside the cushions. Bhuvi never looked like taking that",1681054749835

17.5," Umran Malik to Dhawan, , 144.5kph, short on off, Dhawan is rushed but pulls and another top-edge carries over the fence, this time over deep backward square leg ",1681054871369
18.2," Bhuvneshwar to Dhawan, no run,  Yes it is. A low full-toss on the stumps, driven back and this went near shin-height to Bhuvneshwar who drops it off his own bowling after getting both hands. The last one he dropped off his own bowling was easier as it was waist-height, this was tougher ",1681055004985
18.3," Bhuvneshwar to Dhawan, , Dhawan keeps rocking. A back of a length delivery outside off, Dhawan opens the face of the bat and drives through point, in the air but in the gap and beats sweeper cover to his right ",1681055037390
18.4," Bhuvneshwar to Dhawan, , incredible wrists from Dhawan. So strong he is fitness-wise. Full and wide outside off, initially Dhawan was setting up for the scoop, then I0$ and reverse-scoops between backward point and short third man. Sensational ",1681055075135
19.6," T Natarajan to Dhawan, ,  A pity that Dhawan finishes on 99. Slams the low full-toss on the stumps over deep mid-wicket after going low to get under the ball. Walks off still smiling. I0$ ",1681055418487

1.5," Arshdeep Singh to Mayank, , 138.8kph, dug in short, leg-lined with fine leg inside the circle. Mayank picks the length early, gets inside the line and pulls it away for a one-bounce four. Used the bowler's angle and pace to his advantage ",1681056850808
