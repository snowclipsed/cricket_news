What's in store today? Let's find out..",1681044367500,66236
preview,"Nothing has clicked for  so far. They've already used two different opening pairs in as many outings, Harry Brook flopped in both the matches, Mayank Agarwal hasn't been able to bring his domestic form into this tournament and too much has been asked of the lower order. Even their bowling has been well below par. Hyderabad have the worst NRR and are currently languishing at the bottom of the table but it's still early days in the tourney. It'll be interesting to see what changes they make. The probably missed a trick by not using Heinrich Klaasen as the Impact Player in the previous match. Should Marco Jansen make it to the XI? How long will they back Brook? A lot to ponder for the Sunrisers!",1681044694612,66236
preview,"Lost the toss twice, asked to bat first twice but  emerged victorious on both occasions. Three Indian batters in the top-four - Prabhsimran Singh, Shikhar Dhawan and Jitesh Sharma - made notable contributions in both the games. Bhanuka Rajapaksa scored a fifty in the first match but was forced to retire hurt in the previous match as he suffered a blow on the hand when he was standing at the non-striker's end. Following Punjab's win over RR, the Sri Lankan tweeted ""The X-rays have cleared me of any broken bones/fractures! Plenty of ice needed but I'm doing fine!""

19.6, Bizarre innings fron PBKS.  Bizarre things happened in the innings too - I0$. Anyway PBKS will have to thank Dhawan for one of the best T20 innings of all-time considering how shambolically bad the others were. It all started with Prabhsimran getting out first ball of the innings to Bhuvi and the caravan just did not stop. Dhawan saw one after the other leave as SRH's seamers and Mayank Markande's leggies and googlies proved to be lethal.  From 63/3 PBKS slipped to 78/8 and then 88/9 at the end of 15 overs. But Dhawan then took charge as 55 came off the last 5 overs in which he farmed the strike. Only good bowling from Natarajan in the last over denied what was a fantastic and thoroughly well-deserved 100 for Dhawan. Some of the shots that PBKS played in that collapse was shocking to say the least. Dhawan's innings has given PBKS a tiny lease of life though. Can they make use of it?

post," Was very happy with my knock. As a batting unit, we lost too many wickets and couldn't put a big total and because of that we lost the game. 175-180 would have been a reasonable score. It was seaming and swinging, we couldn't tackle that and fell short. I was pleased (with the bowling), there was not much to defend, lot of learning for us from this game. We'll analyse where we can get better. I am enjoying the captaincy, have a great bunch of boys, just taking it day-by-day. Captaincy doesn't affect me, I just back my plans. With so much experience, I know how to play with a calm mind.",1681061712817,66236
post," Was very happy with my knock. As a batting unit, we lost too many wickets and couldn't put a big total and because of that we lost the game. 175-180 would have been a reasonable score.

post," Very happy to get an opportunity. My role is to take wickets in the middle overs. I bowled slowly and fortunately got the wickets. With the impact rule, you should always be prepared. The talks with Adil Rashid has helped me. During the red-ball season, I worked hard with Aavishkar Salvi. I rate this performance very high, happy to contribute.",1681061712827,66236

post," It was special. It was a bit rough for us at the start but we are happy to win today. I believe that our great fan base was a privilege tonight. To get a win in front of them was very pleasing. Identifying how we can get better was quite important. But it was still about believing in ourselves.  (On Markande replacing Rashid) It's not a nice move to make but I am super happy for Markande. He bowled really well tonight. He has a lot of heart about him. (On Rahul Tripathi) He is only a couple of balls away from something special and he showed his class tonight. It's easy with Rahul at the other end. Great franchise to be a part of and it's our first win of the season, it means a lot.",1681062199500,66236

post," I didn't expect I will reach there (99*) at the end of the day. As a batting unit, we had a plan. The way we thought about the wicket, it was a bit different. It was initially seaming and swinging and it was a bit low as well but we should have moulded our game. I am grateful for the 99 and I am very happy. I was playing according to the situation and kept scoring boundaries when it was needed.",1681062595520,66236

post,"We witnessed two contrasting games today. Rinku pulled off the unthinkable in the game against GT, hitting five sixes in a row in the last over to take KKR to a memorable victory. SRH won comfortably against PBKS. Although, we will remember this game more because of Dhawan’s superlative knock. Join us tomorrow for what will be another high-voltage contest as RCB are back home and they will host LSG. This is  signing off on behalf of  and .
