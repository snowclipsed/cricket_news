preview," Hello and welcome to our coverage of today's evening game between Lucknow Super Giants and Delhi Capitals. It's the first time LSG will get to play at their home ground since joining the IPL last year, and will be eager to hit the ground running after a good showing in 2022 where they made the playoffs.

preview,"Both teams are awaiting the arrival of their South African players. Quinton de Kock, who scored a 43-ball hundred recently against the West Indies, will be a big miss at the top of the order for LSG. In comparison, DC have an explosive top three in Warner, Prithvi Shaw and Mitchell Marsh. However, they are without Anrich Nortje and Lungi Ngidi today. All three are expected to join after South Africa's final ODI against Netherlands.",1680272993906,66176
preview," ""65 meters to my left, 62 to my right. And it will need a good thump down the ground at 77 meters. Importantly, the 22-yards is interesting because there's very little grass at this end. It's very bare and the ball may grip on this half. As I walk down, you can see the disparity. You get to the middle, you start seeing more grass, and it's patchy as well. So it's a pitch with contrasting halves. There's so much more grass on one side, but it's patchy grass. So when it hits the bald areas, it could hold. Hoping that the red soil makes the bounce and carry."" - ",1680272993916,66176

19.6," LSG will be extremely pleased to reach 193 considering the poor start they got off to. Rahul was scratchy in his short stay and Sakariya got the better of him quite early in the innings. The DC pacers were disciplined and kept the lid on the scoring-rate, not allowing the batters to get any sort of rhythm. LSG were 30/1 after the powerplay but things changed after that. Mayers was dropped in the final over of the powerplay by Khaleel and he made DC pay. He smashed Mukesh for two boundaries and that got him going. He took the attack to both Kuldeep and Axar and found the boundaries at will. However, Kuldeep and Axar struck in tandem in the 11th and 12th over to send both Hooda and Mayers packing but the latter had done quite some damage by then. Stoinis couldn't do much but a powerful cameo from Pooran and a few lusty blows from Badoni in the slog overs meant that LSG finished on a high. Khaleel did well with the ball but his dropped catch of Mayers can cost his side. There's dew on the field and the boundaries are not big. It sets up for a good finish.

post," That's a pretty comprehensive win for Lucknow Super Giants and they've opened their season in style. The LSG players haven't disappointed the thousands of fans present at their home venue. Their batters set the tone by posting a massive total, and the bowlers have made sure to complement that with a wily performance. Mayers who was dropped by Khaleel made sure that Capitals paid for their mistake. He scored a brisk fifty following the powerplay, and Pooran too chipped in with a handy cameo as the Giants finished with a massive total of 193/6.",1680371829166,66176

post,"In reply, the Capitals got off to a brisk start, but Mark Wood came into the attack and completely derailed DC's innings. He knocked over Shaw and Marsh with jaffas on back-to-back deliveries, and the Capitals could never recover from those blows. The spinners built further pressure, and although there was a handy partnership between Warner and Rossouw, the required run rate had inflated so much, that there was no chance of a comeback. In short, it was a clinical performance by the Lucknow boys. Stay around for the presentations..",1680371829176,66176

post," What a brilliant start for us. Got the big boys firing. Woody bowling 160kph, Mayers hitting 160 meters (not literally). That's what the coaches say - nice problems to have (with QDK coming in). Don't know if you guys can tell, but it was absolutely soaking (dew). We do practice under lights. There's not much you can do. It's quite a sandy surface. Just have to take your time to dry the ball for the bowlers. Pitch looked different on each end. One end spun a little more. And Mayers gave himself a bit of time before exploding. I thought I would've been handy on that wicket (with the ball). Just wasn't needed.",1680371829186,66176

post," It was a bit of a challenge. We had some early momentum with the fast bowlers, they bowled very well in the powerplay. A few dropped catches and the momentum shifted there but you can't take anything away from Lucknow. They batted very very well. I thought 170 was par but they did an exceptional job. Momentum is a big thing in this game. Don't take it away from Wood, he's an exceptional bowler and he showed his true talent tonight. I feel on this wicket you're playing on two different surfaces from either end. We started very well. Our bowlers bowled exceptionally well. (On the knock of Mayers) When one guy goes big, he is a big strong boy. He was hard to stop. We go back to Delhi in front of our home crowd. We have to assess the wicket there. Last time I was in Delhi back in 2010-11 it was low and slow. It looks like there's a bit of green grass there now with some dew coming in late in the night. (On being asked about the pitch in the Delhi Test last month) That was a bit of a different wicket with the red ball and we will forget about that (chuckles while saying that).",1680371829196,66176

post," It was a great start. We were clueless of the pitch, nice way to start. We'll take confidence from this win. Toss is not in our hands, with the new rules you get to play with the team you want. Gives great depth in bowling and batting. I thought we were 30 runs above par. The way Kyle (Mayers) batted. We took an aggressive approach against the spinners and put them under pressure. I thought they started well, but we came back well. It was Wood's day today, it's a dream for a fast bowler and a team. He made it count. Overall, the bowling group did well and put pressure on the batters. We are not going to make too much of it, we'll take confidence from it. It's T20 cricket, you need to turn up everyday and be ready for the fight. We don't want to think too much about this win.",1680372932601,66176

post," Last time I played for CSK, but it didn't go quite well. But I wanted to make an impact in this game. The landing area was bit of an issue, but I am pleased with my rhythm as I managed to take wickets. You could see the dew on the grass and it affected me. I fall even at the best of times. We have trained here, so we knew dew was going to be a factor. KL tried to keep things simple for me and the planning with Morne helped me. I was trying to keep my strides short (due to the wet outfield). Trained here before during practice games, but the intensity was different, not as much as it was tonight. Was worried a bit about slipping but I will try to shrug that off next time.",1680373127673,66176
