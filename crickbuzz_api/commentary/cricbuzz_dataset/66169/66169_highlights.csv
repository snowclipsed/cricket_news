1.1," Hardik Pandya to Gaikwad, , back of a length around middle, and it's been clipped away beautifully by Gaikwad! He hangs back and shows lovely wristwork to get it purring through midwicket ",1680271750399
1.3,"Hardik Pandya to Gaikwad, , lovely drive on the up for four! Slightly fuller than a good length just outside off, not a bad ball but Gaikwad gets forward and hits it crisply through point",1680271774827
2.2,"Shami to Conway,  Bowled!!  who has made a mess of the stumps! Full, fast, slanted in from round the wicket. And it's a very loose drive from Conway. His front foot doesn't go anywhere, the ball nips in sharply, goes through the gate and clatters into middle and off. ",1680272017214
3.1," Joshua Little to Gaikwad, ,  Short of length into the body, Gaikwad swivels across and pulls it over short fine. It sails over the ropes ",1680272336441
3.2," Joshua Little to Gaikwad, , now he offers width and gets slapped through point! This absolutely flew off Gaikwad's bat! 10 off the first two balls of the over ",1680272378046
3.5,"Joshua Little to Moeen Ali, , this takes the splice and still goes for four, adding to Little's misery! Back of a length just outside off, Moeen goes hard on the drive but it climbs on him to hit high on the bat. No timing on it. However, once it finds the gap through point, the ball races away",1680272513881
4.3,"Shami to Moeen Ali, ,  Good length just outside off, Moeen doesn't move his feet much - if at all - as he goes for the drive, and creams it through extra cover",1680272722023
4.4," Shami to Moeen Ali, , ! Pitched up in the slot just outside off, Moeen clears the front leg, has a hefty swing and powers it over the ropes ",1680272809553
4.5," Shami to Moeen Ali, , back of a length around middle, not all that short but Moeen is still able to pull it through midwicket ",1680272863598
5.3," Rashid Khan to Moeen Ali, no run,  Again he misses a sweep and this time there's no bat involved. But it has pitched outside leg stump ever so slightly. The decision is reversed! ",1680273134307
5.4," Rashid Khan to Moeen Ali, , dances down, isn't quite to the pitch of this googly but goes through with the shot! And he's somehow able to nail it right off the middle! What a powerful blow down the ground. Rashid stuck his hand out for the catch but the ball was already past him ",1680273157726
5.5," Rashid Khan to Moeen Ali,  Caught by Saha!! Gone! Saha just about hangs onto it! Full outside off, Moeen swings hard looking to go over extra cover but edges it behind as Rashid strikes right back after the boundary.  ",1680273196339
6.3," Hardik Pandya to Gaikwad, , nowhere near the middle from Gaikwad but it hits the cushions on the full! Pitched up just outside off, Gaikwad seems to be early through the lofted drive and gets it close to the bottom. Still goes for six over extra cover. Oh wait, the umps seem to be checking whether it touched the spider-cam cables on the way. Would be a dead-ball if it did. It's hard to figure it out from the replays and it looks like the six will stand ",1680273593833
6.4," Hardik Pandya to Gaikwad, , six more, and this goes much further! Full outside off, Gaikwad swings through the line, has a bigger flourish than the previous shot and hits it over the long-off boundary ",1680273811809
6.6," Hardik Pandya to Gaikwad, no run, ! He taps this in front of cover and charges for a single, only for Stokes to send him back after taking a few steps down. Gaikwad was already halfway down the pitch. The fielder has a shy and misses ",1680273887163
7.3,"Rashid Khan to Stokes, , quite full outside off at 96.6kph, Stokes initially back away, then has to reach out and nearly falls over in doing so. But he somehow still generates a lot of power to hammer it down the ground! ",1680274041637
7.4," Rashid Khan to Stokes,  Caught by Saha!! Definite edge there. Yes the finger goes up. Stokes is undone as he misjudges length, and goes back to a leg-break he should've been forward to. It's pushed through flat just outside off, Stokes tries punching it through cover but it skids through sharply, taking a nick to the keeper. Another good catch from Saha.  ",1680274090787
8.1," Alzarri Joseph to Gaikwad, , 141.5kph, full delivery slanted into the pads, and Gaikwad effortlessly picks it up and flicks it away for six over long leg! He's just in sublime touch out there! ",1680274309712
8.4," Alzarri Joseph to Gaikwad, ,  for Gaikwad who sends another one into the stands! The crowd erupts in applause, as do his CSK teammates! Back of a length around the waist, Gaikwad stands tall and pulls it right off the middle. It goes deep into the crowd over square leg ",1680274434070
8.6," Alzarri Joseph to Gaikwad, , another delivery that's on the shorter side but not short enough to trouble Gaikwad! It's neither here nor there, sits up around the tummy and Gaikwad pulls it high in the air. Don't think he middled it like the previous one, but it still goes the distance over square leg ",1680274541959
10.6," Joshua Little to Gaikwad, , massive six! He's feasting on this length! Short of length delivery around the chest, Gaikwad swivels across and whacks the pull away over square leg. And it travels a long way! It was a good over until this delivery, with just one run off five balls ",1680275027673
11.1," Yash Dayal to Rayudu, 1 run,  Rayudu gives charge looking to go over mid-off and slices it in the air. The ball is well wide of Pandya who charges across from mid-off, puts in a full-length dive to his left but it evades him ",1680275152093
11.3," Yash Dayal to Gaikwad, , Gaikwad continues in his merry ways! Slower one floated up outside off, Gaikwad spots it, waits for it and swings through the line over mid-off! ",1680275253094
11.6," Yash Dayal to Rayudu, , now Rayudu joins the party! Slower one around middle and leg, sits up around the waist and Rayudu heaves it over midwicket. Hasn't quite middled it, but has got enough to clear the midwicket boundary ",1680275430860
12.3," Joshua Little to Gaikwad, , oh no, ! Excellent effort at the midwicket boundary from him. He catches it and flicks it in the air before going over the ropes. But as he lands, he hurts his right knee and seems to be in a lot of trouble. The physio is attending to him outside the boundary. A slower length ball, Gaikwad whacks it across the line, goes flat to Williamson who does so well to toss it back inside before the mishap occurs. The ball rolls into the boundary ",1680275687135
12.5,"Joshua Little to Rayudu,  Bowled!! Gives the charge to slog and is cleaned up! A full delivery that tails away, Rayudu looks to swing down the ground but is beaten on the edge. It clatters into the stumps. ",1680275770947
14.3," Hardik Pandya to Shivam Dube, leg byes, , not a great delivery by Hardik Pandya. Short ball on leg and it clips Shivam Dube's thigh pad and races away to the fine leg fence in a canter. Hardik Pandya hasn't been up to the mark tonight, and even he knows that ",1680276498553
16.1," Rashid Khan to Gaikwad, , welcome back into the attack Mr. Rashid. A short ball by him, googly and Gaikwad rocks back to hammer the pull over wide long-on for a flat six ",1680277004332
16.4," Rashid Khan to Shivam Dube, byes, 1 run, 98 clicks, quicker leg-break, Shivam Dube swings and misses, was really close to kissing the leg-stump ",1680277126015
17.1," Alzarri Joseph to Gaikwad,  Caught by Shubman Gill!! So near, yet so far. That was a pretty high full toss, but just below the waist as confirmed by the third umpire. It was dipping in. Gaikwad was looking to whack that away to the fence, but couldn't middle it. Gill at long-on is quick to charge in as he completes a pretty impressive catch diving forward. End of a spectacular knock for Gaikwad. Some of those shots were simply outstanding. The change of bats results in his downfall.  ",1680277375412
17.4,"Alzarri Joseph to Jadeja,  Caught by Shankar!! Straight to deep mid-wicket. A full length delivery on middle and leg, and Jadeja flicks it stylishly. Gets enough elevation, but not the required distance. Wasn't that easy a catch, but Vijay Shankar stationed near the boundary makes it look like one. Reverse cups it and that's that for RJ for tonight. ",1680277590892
18.1," Shami to Shivam Dube, 2 runs,  Goes for a pull against this short ball, gets a top edge towards fine leg though. Saha sprints back and puts in a dive, but that's out of his reach, good try by the keeper ",1680277804152
18.2," Shami to Shivam Dube, , that is what was missing! Shivam Dube finally strikes one, right off the meat. Shami goes short and hammers the pull over the leg-side for a clean six. Would have been one on any ground ",1680277880185
18.3," Shami to Shivam Dube,  Caught by Rashid Khan!! Shami's a strike bowler and he'll continue to be one. That's a comeback you can expect from him. Conceded a six against a short ball just on the last ball, and he challenges the batter with another short one. Shivam Dube goes for a pull just like he did on the last ball, but this time he ends up getting a top edge. Straight to Rashid at deep square leg and he's not going to miss out on those.  ",1680277944429
19.3," Joshua Little to Dhoni, ,  Doesn't disappoint his fans and those chants. Typical Dhoni. Back of a length delivery by Joshua Little and the boss has dispatched this over deep square with a ferocious pull. The crowd goes even louder, even wilder ",1680278370486
19.4," Joshua Little to Dhoni, , and now Hardik Pandya looks annoyed, not at all happy. This was on the pads and MSD flicked it over square leg for a boundary, no one in the deep so there was no chance to stop it ",1680278457055
1.1," Tushar Deshpande to Saha, ,  Back of a length delivery around middle, slight away seam, Saha looks to swipe it across the line and the top edge flies over third man, just eludes the fielder stationed near the boundary ",1680280142002
1.2," Tushar Deshpande to Saha, , short ball by Tushar Deshpande, and Saha pulls it over mid-wicket for four runs. Tushar Deshpande gives the batter a stare, but he's the one under pressure ",1680280178403
1.5," Tushar Deshpande to Shubman Gill, , forehand smash! Stands tall and whips this short of a length delivery through mid-wicket, right into the gap and that's a boundary ",1680280311268
2.5," Chahar to Saha, ,  Saha latches on to it and smokes it over deep square leg with a clean pull shot ",1680280601621
3.2," RS Hangargekar to Saha, ,  Dispatches the short ball over mid-wicket with a pull and there's no chance of stopping it ",1680280870075
3.5,"RS Hangargekar to Saha,  Caught by Shivam Dube!! Hangargekar strikes in his first over. Saha flashes away from his body against this length ball and the thick outside edge flies towards square third man. Dube sprints across to his right, keeps his eyes on the ball and completes a fantastic catch diving to his right. Saha is waiting on the sidelines to check out for the replays, but it's a clean catch. The opening partnership has been broken, so we can expect a few more wickets over the next few overs. ",1680281006889
3.6,"RS Hangargekar to Sai Sudharsan, , the impact player is up and running straightaway! Drifting on the pads and Sai Sudharsan times his flick through square leg for a rollicking boundary to open his account",1680281213937
4.1," Tushar Deshpande to Shubman Gill, ,  All class. Back of a length delivery around off, Shubman Gill stands tall and punches it on the rise through cover for an authoritative boundary ",1680281281252
4.3," Tushar Deshpande to Shubman Gill, , here's the Gilly-copter! On a length around middle and leg, stays put and helicopters it over deep mid-wicket in style ",1680281422178
5.4," Santner to Sai Sudharsan, , shorter delivery around off, Sai Sudharsan rocks back and spanks it over cover for four runs ",1680281720047
5.6," Santner to Shubman Gill, , fraction short outside off, Shubman Gill rocks back and carves it through backward point to end the powerplay with a boundary ",1680281792012
7.3," Santner to Sai Sudharsan, , too short and on the body. Pulled precisely between deep backward square leg and deep mid-wicket. Sai Sudharsan looking confident with each passing stroke... ",1680282119231
7.5," Santner to Shubman Gill, , fired full and wide, Gill stepped out and chips it over extra cover into the wide pocket on that side of the field for a boundary ",1680282188781
8.5," Jadeja to Shubman Gill, 1 run, flat onto leg, clipped towards deep square.  ",1680282554509
9.3," RS Hangargekar to Sai Sudharsan,  Caught by Dhoni!! Gone!! Soft dismissal!! This was a length ball very wide, was the cutter. Sai Sudharsan went chasing to cut and gets a faint underedge that carries through to Dhoni. Sai Sudharsan has a wry smile on his face for playing at that, would have been wide otherwise...Is this CSK's route back in the game?  ",1680282745302
10.5," Jadeja to Shubman Gill, , full and sliding down leg with the arm, Gill gets some bat onto his sweep that takes the ball fine on the leg side. No chance for the fielder in the circle and runs away for four.. ",1680283067040
10.6," Jadeja to Shubman Gill, , wow!! What a hit. This was flat on off, Gill danced out nearly to the pitch of it. Wasn't at it but went through with the inside out slap that goes for a flat six over wide long-off. I0$ ",1680283103363
11.2," Santner to Shubman Gill, 1 run, slow outside off, slapped towards the sweeper and that's 50 for Shubman Gill - a line I've gotten very used to saying on commentary.. ",1680283216546
12.1," Jadeja to Hardik Pandya,  Bowled!! Knocked over!! This was a flat delivery on off that zipped through. Pandya goes for a cross batted sweep and the ball skids through before to take out his off stump. Didn't need to play a risky shot, ends up costing him the wicket today.  ",1680283403109
13.2," RS Hangargekar to Shankar, , short and on the body, Shankar waits and lets it arrive onto him before pulling to the left of fine leg. Well played! ",1680283717973
13.6," RS Hangargekar to Shubman Gill, , slower bouncer, Gill was early on the pull and top-edges it but luckily for him there is no fine leg in place. The ball ambles away to the fence, another boundary ",1680283919046
14.5," Tushar Deshpande to Shubman Gill, , good length on the pads, pulled through deep mid-wicket. Ruturaj Gaikwad was there in the deep but he was a few yards in. Runs back hurriedly but only parries it over the boundary ropes ",1680284230052
14.6," Tushar Deshpande to Shubman Gill,  Caught by Gaikwad!! Action replay delivery and this time Gill is gone. The GT opener goes for the big slap across the line again, but this time gets more elevation than distance. The elevation helps Gaikwad run in from the boundary ropes and complete a fine pouch.  ",1680284280608
15.3," Santner to Shankar, , slow outside off, slapped between deep extra cover and long-off. Both fielders ran towards it and then stopped to look at each other's faces, gifting Shankar a boundary!! ",1680284473774
17.3," RS Hangargekar to Rahul Tewatia, 1 run, yorker length on off, pushed towards mid-off for a risky single. Tewatia makes it home but the throw was also wide ",1680285190354
17.4," RS Hangargekar to Shankar, , Hangargekar goes short, Vijay Shankar read the length yesterday and was ready deep in his crease with a side-on stance to whack it over deep mid-wicket for a maximum. Big six!!! ",1680285257083
17.5," RS Hangargekar to Shankar, no run, full toss outside off. Looked high and pretty wide as well, but umpire doesn't call wide. Vijay Shankar reviews it Hangargekar gets away with it. Just inside the wide line (debatable) and the on-field decision stays! ",1680285302164
17.6," RS Hangargekar to Shankar,  Caught by Santner!! Big, big wicket!! What an IPL debut this young kid is having. This was an attempted yorker, falls marginally short and Shankar tries to dig it over the infield. Gets enough elevation but not the distance, and a back-tracking Santner always had eyes on the ball to complete a superb reverse cup.  ",1680285495600
18.2," Chahar to Rahul Tewatia, leg byes, , attempted yorker, deflects off the boots and runs away past MS Dhoni's full length dive to his right. Boundary to fine leg! ",1680285646234
18.4," Chahar to Rashid Khan, , Oh my goodness!! This was a slower one that was pitched up, Rashid Khan clears his front leg and gives it an almighty slog over deep mid-wicket. That was his first ball, would you believe it? ",1680285757069
18.5," Chahar to Rashid Khan, , short on off, Rashid Khan gets it off the bottom and it flies over short third for a boundary. One bounce and into the fence. Game sealed? ",1680285831753
19.1," Tushar Deshpande to Rahul Tewatia, , that should seal it!! This was full outside off, Tewatia shuffled across his stumps, gets under the ball and hoists his drive over mid-off. Sails all the way for six. Scores are level ",1680286015140
19.2," Tushar Deshpande to Rahul Tewatia, , he's done it again!! New season, same old Rahul Tewatia. Tushar Deshpande dishes out a yorker, Tewatia slams it straight as an arrow down the ground for four. Didn't even bother running, points his fingers towards the sky and then extends his arms in celebration, as if to ask if the game was ever in doubt with him in the middle!! The Champions are off to a winning start... ",1680286063094
