But if this is the trailer, then the Yashavi Jaiswal blockbuster is going to light up our television screen for a generation to come. Kudos to the IPL - where talent meets opportunity!! We can go off to bed early tonight thinking about that Jaiswal knock, but we'll be back tomorrow when MI host the champions Gujarat. Join us then, for now this is B0$signing off on behalf of B1$and B2$",

Never have to speak to him, give him the ball and he knows what to do. He bowls at the death as well, very pleasing for me as a captain. (On the road ahead) We have two more quarter finals to play, the pressure in never off in the IPL. Each game, each over is important.

Today was such an innings, and Yashasvi Jaiswal is quickly becoming that sort of player who makes you pause from life - a generational talent!! This game was finished within the first over, when Jaiswal started the chase with two consecutive sixes off the first two balls. He then continued the onslaught against Harshit Rana, and then hit Shardul Thakur for a hat-trick of fours to secure the fastest fifty in IPL history. He got there in 13 balls, yes you read that correctly!! And he got there by playing pure cricketing shots, shots that had even the home ground stand up and clap in awe of the youngster. Sanju Samson played his role with a stroke filled 48 as well, as RR chased down the target with almost seven overs to spare. Anyone remember that Jos Buttler got out for a duck or a certain Joe Root is yet to bat in the IPL? RR were on a three match losing streak, but what a rousing reply this has been.

This game was finished within the first over, when Jaiswal started the chase with two consecutive sixes off the first two balls. He then continued the onslaught against Harshit Rana, and then hit Shardul Thakur for a hat-trick of fours to secure the fastest fifty in IPL history. He got there in 13 balls, yes you read that correctly!! And he got there by playing pure cricketing shots, shots that had even the home ground stand up and clap in awe of the youngster. Sanju Samson played his role with a stroke filled 48 as well, as RR chased down the target with almost seven overs to spare.

Venkatesh Iyer and captain Nitish Rana steadied the ship somewhat after that. Venkatesh Iyer was slow to get off the blocks but he broke the shackles with successive sixes off Ashwin in the 10th over. At the halfway stage, the hosts were 76/2 and would have eyed a formidable total. But Chahal had other ideas. He removed Rana in his very first over and thereby became IPL's leading wicket-taker. He went for 15 in his 2nd over but came back strongly. Removed half-centurion Iyer and Thakur within a span of four deliveries and had the in-form Rinku Singh hole out. The legspinner choked KKR and finished with 4/25. Sandeep Sharma bowled two tight overs in the death and ensured that the Knight Riders didn't cross 150. Way too many dot balls and will that come back to haunt the home team? There's enough assistance for the spinners here but RR have a very good chance here to end their 3-match losing streak and jump to the third spot. Join us in a bit to find out how the action unfolds..",

    "commText": "B0$    \\n    \\n\"Arre sir, saral saral pooch lena.\"    \\n    \\nThat was Rinku Singh on match eve, light-heartedly requesting the press to ask him easy questions, when he's had all the answers this season. The crowd at Eden Gardens knew it when they screamed \"Rinku! Rinku!\" in the middle of a tight finish against Punjab Kings. Andre Russell knew it in the same match when he ran a possible bye off the penultimate delivery and trusted Rinku with the finishing job. Kolkata Knight Riders, of course, have known it ever since acquiring his services in 2017.    \\n    \\nRinku Singh will once again be in focus when KKR take on Rajasthan Royals at home. He will have happy memories of playing them too. His match-winning innings of 42* off 23 against RR last year won him his first Player-of-the-Match award in IPL and proved to be a turning point in his career at KKR, establishing him as one of their key players. Rinku hasn't missed a game for KKR ever since.    \\n    \\nWhile KKR go into this fixture with three wins in the last four games, it's lately been a jarring ride for RR who have lost five of their last six games. That they are still placed above KKR on the points table tells you how superlative their start of the season was.    \\n    \\nNow tasked with putting their campaign back on track, it wouldn't be an easy job for RR at the Eden Gardens, where the home side finally seemed to have cracked the winning formula after a tough initiation. A part of it was down to the slightly dry pitch KKR played on against PBKS, which brought their spinners more into play without compromising too much on the batting. The same pitch, where spinners picked 8/142 as compared to 3/211 by seamers, will be used for this game too and is likely to play to KKR's strengths again. RR, though, arrive with two of India's best spinners in their ranks and a batting line-up that wouldn't mind the bounce on offer either.    \\n    \\nAs both teams play their third-last league game of the season, one is set to break away from the mid-table 10-pointer traffic jam. Who will be that, though, is hard to guess, and that's perhaps one question that even Rinku Singh might not have an answer to yet.    \\n    \\nB1$KKR vs RR on May 11, 2023 at 7:30 PM local    \\n    \\nB2$ Eden Gardens, Kolkata    \\n    \\nB3$The game will again be played on pitch #4, same as last night, which will make it the fourth IPL game to be played on the surface this season.    \\n    \\nWith a deep depression forming in the Bay of Bengal owing to Cyclone Mocha, the conditions 24 hours out from the match were cloudy although it didn't rain and impede teams' practice. That, however, meant that the pitch once again wasn't watered much and is likely to have more in it for the slower bowlers this time around. Unequal ground dimensions on both sides (58 meters and 71 meters) is likely to once again heavily influence match tactics.    \\n    \\nNo dew is expected although the last couple of games at the venue have been won by chasing sides. That will make for a tricky decision for Sanju Samson at the toss; RR have won only one out of their four games while chasing this season. No rain is forecast during the match but that could change quickly given the cyclonic conditions in the vicinity. The groundsmen covered the entire field of play on the eve of the match expecting overnight rain.    \\n    \\nB4$    \\n    \\nB5$    \\n    \\nUmesh Yadav, who has been sidelined with a minor left hamstring injury for the last three games, bowled with a full run-up on the eve of the match. He was seen bowling to Rinku Singh on the center practice wicket alongside other first-choice Varun Chakaravarthy, Andre Russell, Sunil Narine and Harshit Rana, with Vaibhav Arora not part of the drill. What that could mean is anybody's guess but that possible change aside, KKR are unlikely to tinker with a winning combination.    \\n    \\nB6$Nitish Rana has been one of the best players of spin in the last few editions of IPL but seems to struggle a bit against Yuzvendra Chahal, who has accounted for him five times in the past. This key battle will be crucial for both sides looking to get an important win under their belt. That said, KKR also have an ace in Sunil Narine against the opposition captain Sanju Samson, who's gotten out to the spinner thrice and scores against him at a modest strike-rate of 82.    \\n    \\nB7$Rahmanullah Gurbaz(w), Jason Roy, Venkatesh Iyer, Nitish Rana(c), Rinku Singh, Andre Russell, Sunil Narine, Shardul Thakur, Vaibhav Arora/Umesh Yadav, Harshit Rana, Varun Chakaravarthy. [Impact Player: Suyash Sharma]    \\n    \\nB8$    \\n    \\nTrent Boult missed the last match with a niggle but should come right back into the Playing XI for this one. Expect them to play three spinners too on this track.    \\n    \\nB6$This year, RR have been one of the worst sides in the middle overs, losing as many as 32 wickets for only 749 runs from overs 7-15. That's got a lot to do with Shimron Hetmyer's dip in form, the batter totalling only 25 runs in his last six innings. How he and others in the middle-order fare against KKR's three-pronged spin attack could shape the match.    \\n    \\nB10$ Yashasvi Jaiswal, Jos Buttler, Sanju Samson(w/c), Devdutt Padikkal, Shimron Hetmyer, Dhruv Jurel, Ravichandran Ashwin, Trent Boult, Adam Zampa, Sandeep Sharma, Yuzvendra Chahal [Impact Player: Riyan Parag]    \\n    \\nB11$    \\n    \\n- Yuzvendra Chahal one away from becoming the leading-wicket taker in IPL history.    \\n    \\n- Jason Roy vs Trent Boult in T20s: 25 balls, 34 runs, 2 dismissals    \\n    \\n- Four of Andre Russell's eight dismissals this season have come against right arm leg-spin    \\n    \\nB12$    \\n    \\n\"KKR are a good side. Andre Russell is one of the most devastating batters in T20s. He has been out a few times, but bowling to him is difficult. Also, one should not forget Rinku Singh\" - B13$ on how he looks at KKR    \\n    \\n\"He's the best finisher in the world. I asked him, 'What else canI do in the middle?' He said, 'Don't think much, just wait for the ball.'\" - B14$ on his interaction with MS Dhoni",
