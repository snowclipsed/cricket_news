Rohit got some runs under his belt, SKY continued to soar, Vishnu Vinod made the most of his chance, Madhwal came out trumps with the new ball and Chawla provided the wickets in the middle overs. Gujarat Titans never got going in the chase. They lost three wickets in the powerplay and a couple more soon after, Miller and Tewatia steadied the procession but fell off consecutive deliveries. The game was almost done there but Rashid kept the crowd entertained with his 21-ball fifty and ensured that the margin of defeat was much lesser. Presentations coming up..",

    "commText": "B0$     \\n  \\nThank God, I am retired.\" Harbhajan Singh, one of India's finest white ball spinners of all-time, heaved a sigh of relief while speaking informally to journalists after the last game at the Wankhede the other night (on May 9). Mumbai Indians had just sauntered to a target of 200 in a wink - in just about 16 overs that is. That was a high-speed chase against bowlers of the calibre of Josh Hazlewood, Mohammed Siraj, Wanindu Hasaranga and Harshal Patel.   \\n   \\nIt's no rocket science that the playing conditions and surface conditions have made life difficult for the bowlers. Totals of 200 have become a norm this IPL season across the board and the Wankhede has been no exception. The last three games at the ground saw chases of over 200-run targets - MI knocked off 213 versus Rajasthan Royals on April 30 and ended up at 201 for six while pursuing a target of 215 on April 22.   \\n   \\nThe surface at the stadium has become a belter - the bowlers' nightmare -- and Harbhajan had once labelled such pitches as highways. It has been run-fests all along and it is unlikely the proceedings will be any different here on Friday night when Mumbai Indians and Gujarat Titans, two power house sides with some in-form batsmen, will clash.   \\n   \\n   \\n\"To have fresh batters is really important. We try to bowl outside their hitting arcs, make the batters hit in our areas,\" said Jason Behrendorff, the Mumbai pacer on ways to stem the flow of runs. Teammate Kumar Kathikeya added: \"T20 is a batters game. Nowadays batters hit 360 degrees, so as a bowler, it is important to focus on the basics. We just try to control the run rate.\"   \\n   \\nVikram Solanki, the director of cricket of the Titans side, agreed. \"Take wickets,\" he said, as the answer to batsmen on a rampage. \"It's tough for the bowlers. The batsmen are pushing the boundaries. They should also because it is the premier competition. Equally, the bowlers respond somehow. They are coming up with plans with their own ways of controlling. But it has been tough this year. The impact player rule means the batting line-ups have lengthened.   \\n   \\n\"The bowlers do find ways to control. That might very well be different from one bowler to the next. But our sort of mindset is to try and be as attacking as possible. The best way to control the run rate is to take wickets,\" Solanki explained the point. \"We've got a very experienced group and it is very well led by Mohammed Shami. He sets the example for the rest to follow.\"   \\n   \\nWith some power hitters in both sides, like Ishan Kishan, Suryakumar Yadav, Cameron Green, Tim David, Tilak Varma, Shubman Gill, Wriddhiman Saha, Hardik Pandya, Vijay Shankar and Rahul Tewatia, another big score of over 200 and an equally gallant chase are expected.   \\n   \\nBut the focus could be mainly on a certain Rohit Sharma. Mumbai Indians will need their skipper, who has been out of sorts this IPL (just 191 runs in 11 games), to fire so that their chances of progressing to the next stage increase. With Suryakumar, who had made a mockery of a 200-run chase in the last game, around, the five-time champions are able to wriggle out of tough chases but the team cannot rely upon always. The captain has to come to the party before it is too late as the game is more important for the home team (12 from 11 games) than the visitors (16 from 11 games).   \\n   \\nB1$Friday, May 12, 7:30PM IST   \\n   \\nB2$ Wankhede Stadium, Mumbai   \\n   \\nB3$ It's the Wankhede. However, good Rashid and Noor are, expect another run-fest.   \\n   \\nB4$ The two sides have only played two games: InBrabourne 2022, MI won by five runs, and in Ahmedabad 2023, GT won by a much higher margin of 55 runs. The current match-up is 1-1, but these sides have never played at the Wankhede before. Expect a cracker between Rashid and the batsmen here.   \\n   \\nB5$ Rohit Sharma aggregates 12 runs in the last five innings (2,3,0,0,7) and five times in 27 balls. His record doesn't look great against Gujarat either. His match-up against Rashid reads three dismissals in 21 balls with just 23 runs. That is, if he actually survives until Rashid comes on, because his match-up against Shami isn't great either - 57 off 51 balls with two dismissals. Ishan Kishan has never been dismissed by Shami but that doesn't mean he doesn't struggle, having scored 42 off 45 balls, at a strike rate of 93.33.   \\n   \\nB6$   \\n   \\nB7$ Tilak Varma, one of the batting mainstays of MI side, could come into the XI. The Hyderabad batter had missed out on the last two games. It is unlikely there will be any other change to the side.   \\n   \\nB8$ Rohit Sharma(c), Ishan Kishan(w), Cameron Green, Suryakumar Yadav, Tim David, Nehal Wadhera, Tilak Varma, Chris Jordan, Piyush Chawla, Kumar Kartikeya, Jason Behrendorff   \\n   \\nB9$ A settled side, the Titans mostly went with continuity rather than change. Any change to the XI will only have to be forced rather than experimental and on the eve of the game there have been no signs of any changes.   \\n   \\nB8$ Wriddhiman Saha(w), Shubman Gill, Hardik Pandya(c), Vijay Shankar, David Miller, Abhinav Manohar, Rahul Tewatia, Rashid Khan, Mohit Sharma, Noor Ahmad, Mohammed Shami   \\n   \\nB11$   \\n   \\n\"We have seen some high run chases at the Wankhede. There is a little bit of help for the bowlers initially but after that it is very good for batters. Titans are a very good team. You can plan as much as you want, but I feel execution is more important in T20s -- how you respond on the ground to various situations.\" B12$   \\n   \\n\"I don't think we can take anything for granted in this competition. You have seen games when you think the game is wrapped up and there would be a twist. It has not happened on one occasion but it has happened on a number of occasions. As things stand this year, to take things for granted would be ill-advised. We are totally focussed on this game against a very strong MI side.\" [/b]- Vikram Solanki, Titans director[/b]",
