Lots to ponder over. LSG, meanwhile, have bounced back nicely from their defeat against CSK. And they've done it while leaving Quinton de Kock on the bench, while also missing Mark Wood today due to illness.\u00a0Such are the resources at their disposal. So that's all we have for now. Thanks for joining in. It's a goodbye from Sagar Chawla on behalf of Saurabh Shankar, Kumar Abhishek Das and Venky.",

    "commText": "B0$ Very good day at the office I can say. Both (what he enjoyed more?). Runs, wickets - everything is hard-earned. Everything is special. More right-handers in their lineup - knew I would be bowling four overs. This year I'm in a good headspace. Once you have clarity up there, things fall in places. I'm very process-driven, don't think about results. I took a break from cricket for a few months because I was just playing the white-ball formats, so wanted some time off to work on my bowling. What happened last two-three years was I kept getting wider and wider. Whatever I did in the last 3-4 months - getting taller and getting the ball to turn away, it is all coming out really well. People say I don't turn the ball, so that answers it I guess (Markram wicket). I'm trying to recollect how I played in the first 4-5 years in IPL where I was batting at four for MI. Trying to find that rhythm and consistency. Having the clarity helps. I'm okay with any track. Don't mind if I get a MoM. Want to dedicate this to my wife. She has been a constant support, she is who brings out the best version of myself.",

More right-handers in their lineup - knew I would be bowling four overs. This year I'm in a good headspace. Once you have clarity up there, things fall in places. I'm very process-driven, don't think about results. I took a break from cricket for a few months because I was just playing the white-ball formats, so wanted some time off to work on my bowling. What happened last two-three years was I kept getting wider and wider. Whatever I did in the last 3-4 months - getting taller and getting the ball to turn away, it is all coming out really well. People say I don't turn the ball, so that answers it I guess (Markram wicket). I'm trying to recollect how I played in the first 4-5 years in IPL where I was batting at four for MI. Trying to find that rhythm and consistency. Having the clarity helps. I'm okay with any track. Don't mind if I get a MoM. Want to dedicate this to my wife.

He got Mayank Agarwal early and then dismissed Anmolpreet Singh and Markram in the same over. SRH struggled to get going on this sluggish surface, as Tripathi and Washington Sundar went more defensive. It was also a surface that saw the return of an evergreen IPL figure, as Amit Mishra picked up two wickets while bowling out. Abdul Samad came out and smashed two sixes in the final over, and those could be very valuable runs. A tacky surface, this could be a tricky chase. Something different today in the IPL...",

    "commText": "B0$ by  B1$ \\n \\nOn arrival in Lucknow, you will see a lot of hoardings that announce 'Muskuraiye, aap Lucknow mein hai (Smile, you're in Lucknow)'. It's an old greeting from the city for its visitors. The Ekana International Stadium, built in 'New' Lucknow isn't as courteous though. The invite to the stadium through hoardings on the white exterior walls, visibly clear even 50 meters away, reads: 'Adab se harayenge (We will thrash you, politely)'. \\n \\nFor cricket, Old Lucknow's tehzeeb makes way for New Lucknow's teekhi zubaan. \\n \\nThe bold wordplay, however, can be daunting for the visiting teams only as long as the KL Rahul-led side put on performances worth the weight of their words. The last time they played at the venue - also their first-ever home game - they outplayed Delhi Capitals with bat, ball on the field. Their next visitors - Sunrisers Hyderabad - were at the receiving end of such a dominant performance, from Rajasthan Royals in their opening match. \\n \\nBut that was on one of the six red-soil tracks where LSG had posted 193. On Friday, the contest will be played on the neighbouring black soil pitch; the one that had come in for heavy criticism after India's narrow win in the low-scoring clash against New Zealand in January. However, since Hardik Pandya's comments that \"these wickets are not made for T20s\", a lot of work has gone into reviving its state, and it is expected to be in a fairly better condition for run-scoring. \\n \\nSunrisers Hyderabad have had a fairly slow start to the tournament, playing only a solitary game in the first week and having a longer time to bond off the field. The lop-sided defeat in the opening encounter notwithstanding, they will be buoyed by the availability of their South African players, Aiden Markram and Marco Jansen, with the former set to make his captaincy debut in the IPL, and hope to find their fix quickly in what is expected to be a busier few weeks from hereon. \\n \\nFor LSG, the South African availability - of Quinton de Kock - may have beefed up their options but also left the team management with a selection problem. Kyle Mayers was shielding their early-season concerns on the batting front: KL Rahul's slow starts followed by the lack of press offered by Deepak Hooda and Krunal Pandya, LSG's No 3 and 4 respectively. With de Kock's return, there is a possible threat to that cushion. \\n \\nMoreover, there is uncertainty over how the pitch will play. However, with dew expected to play a part, both the captains would be happy to uphold the customs of Old Lucknow at the toss and say 'pehle aap'. \\n \\nB2$ Lucknow Super Giants vs Sunrisers Hyderabad, Friday, April 7, 2023, 7:30 PM IST \\n \\nB3$ Bharat Ratna Shri Atal Bihari Vajpayee Ekana Cricket Stadium, Lucknow \\n \\nB4$ Following the contest between India and New Zealand in late January, heavy work has been done on the pitch, with extra grass covering added to it. While a lot of work has gone behind making it a higher-scoring track, the results of such efforts will be out on display only when the match starts. \\n \\nB5$ \\n \\nB6$ \\n \\nQuinton De Kock has returned to the side, and that should mean either Marcus Stoinis or Kyle Mayers will have to make way. \\n \\nB7$ LSG have used Deepak Hooda and Krunal Pandya at No 3 and 4 respectively to attack the spinners in the middle overs, and left the late hitting against pacers to Marcus Stoinis and Nicholas Pooran. Even though that specific tactic hasn't worked out for them as well as they would've liked, they may persist with it - especially given Hooda's success against Umran Malik in the middle overs. On the bowling front, Krunal Pandya has been fairly successful against Rahul Tripathi, dismissing the batter thrice in 22 deliveries, and conceding only 26 runs. \\n \\nB8$ KL Rahul, Quinton de Kock, Deepak Hooda, Krunal Pandya, Marcus Stoinis/Kyle Mayers, Nicholas Pooran, Ayush Badoni, Ravi Bishnoi, Mark Wood, Jaydev Unadkat/Yash Thakur, Avesh Khan. \\n \\nThe Impact Substitute swap could be between K Gowtham and Ayush Badoni yet again, depending on whether LSG will chase or bat first. \\n \\nB9$ Aiden Markram, Heinrich Kaasen and Marco Jansen will be available for the match and at least two of them should slot in directly in the XI. \\n \\nB7$ T Natarajan has kept KL Rahul on a leash, conceding only 11 runs in 17 balls, while Bhuvneshwar Kumar has strangled both Rahul and de Kock, with the duo scoring at a rate of only 116 and 94 against the pacer. \\n \\nB8$ Abhishek Sharma, Mayank Agarwal, Rahul Tripathi, Aiden Markram, Harry Brook, Glenn Phillips, Marco Jansen/Adil Rashid, Washington Sundar, Bhuvneshwar Kumar, Umran Malik, T Natarajan \\n \\nAbdul Samad could come in for T Natarajan when SRH bat. \\n \\nB12$ \\n \\nIn the 52-ball face-off between Quinton de Kock and Bhuvneshwar Kumar in IPL, the batter has never been dismissed. However, he has also scored at less than run-a-ball \\n \\nB13$ \\n \\n\"Even though we lost the last game against CSK, there was a lot to learn from it. Despite the loss, we scored close to 200 runs, so it hasn't affected the team (negatively).\" B14$, LSG all-rounder \\n \\n\"As players, you always want to train and get better and improve as a team. But there also comes a time when you probably just need the mental break and freedom to go into the next game. It's not always about fixing it out in the nets. Finding that balance will be important as a team. Everyone in the team has played enough cricket to know what they need to get themselves up for the next game after a loss. We will give the players that freedom to do what they want to, trust what their gut is telling them.\" B15$, SRH captain",
