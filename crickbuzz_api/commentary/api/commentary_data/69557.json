Yes, middle-order has not got ample opportunity. GT are a fantastic team and they've chased very well, so the thought was to get them in. But it was a good toss to lose. If Jaddu gets conditions that help him. he's very difficult to hit. His bowling changed the game. Not to forget his partnership with Moeen. We try to create an environment and work out what is the strength of a fast bowler. We try to give them confidence and tell them 'please try to explore your bowling'. We try to motivate them as much as possible. Support staff is there, Bravo and Eric are there. You see the wicket and according to that you keep adjusting the field. I can be a very annoying captain, I keep shifting fielders 2-3 feet. Only request I ask from the fielders is, keep an eye on me. If there's a dropped catch there will be no reaction (from me), just keep an eye on me. I don't know (back next year?) - I have 8-9 months to decide. Why take that headache now. I'll always be there for CSK, where it's playing or something outside.",

We have to play two days later, we have to play one more game to make sure we reach the final. Just focus on the things that we've done really well this season. That's the beauty about him (Dhoni), with his mind and the way he uses the bowlers, he'll make sure that you'll feel like he's adding 10 runs. We kept losing wickets, he kept making sure that he used the right bowlers, happy for him as well. It would be a really good sight to meet him on Sunday if we can win the next game. Regrets are not good in life, we expected dew might come, it didn't come. We gave 15 runs extra and we didn't do the right things in both the departments.

The pitch slowed down, it offered grip and turn for their spinners and Jadeja and Theekshana were excellent. Figures of 4/46 between them in 8 overs which turned the balance in their favour through the middle-overs. And then Deepak Chahar, who had got rid of Saha with the new ball, came back to break the back of GT by removing Shubman Gill. The jubilant crowd at Chepauk were given a scare towards the end by Rashid Khan. Once again he looked great with the bat to dispatch some loose bowling from Pathirana and Deshpande. But there was too much on his shoulders, and CSK also raised their fielding standards in crunch moments to ensure he didn't have much support. Gujarat Titans, the chase masters, couldn't transcend the conditions today. That's what makes the toss so tricky here. If there was dew, it would've been a completely different scenario. But there wasn't, and CSK had the runs on the board thanks to a good fifty from Gaikwad, and contributions through the lineup from the likes of Conway, Rahane, Rayudu and Jadeja who played useful cameos.",

If Jaddu gets conditions that help him. he's very difficult to hit. His bowling changed the game. Not to forget his partnership with Moeen. We try to create an environment and work out what is the strength of a fast bowler. We try to give them confidence and tell them 'please try to explore your bowling'. We try to motivate them as much as possible. Support staff is there, Bravo and Eric are there. You see the wicket and according to that you keep adjusting the field. I can be a very annoying captain, I keep shifting fielders 2-3 feet. Only request I ask from the fielders is, keep an eye on me. If there's a dropped catch there will be no reaction (from me), just keep an eye on me. I don't know (back next year?) - I have 8-9 months to decide. Why take that headache now.

Figures of 4/46 between them in 8 overs which turned the balance in their favour through the middle-overs. And then Deepak Chahar, who had got rid of Saha with the new ball, came back to break the back of GT by removing Shubman Gill. The jubilant crowd at Chepauk were given a scare towards the end by Rashid Khan. Once again he looked great with the bat to dispatch some loose bowling from Pathirana and Deshpande. But there was too much on his shoulders, and CSK also raised their fielding standards in crunch moments to ensure he didn't have much support. Gujarat Titans, the chase masters, couldn't transcend the conditions today. That's what makes the toss so tricky here. If there was dew, it would've been a completely different scenario. But there wasn't, and CSK had the runs on the board thanks to a good fifty from Gaikwad, and contributions through the lineup from the likes of Conway, Rahane, Rayudu and Jadeja who played useful cameos.",

The CSK openers stitched yet another fifty partnership. While Gaikwad notched up a 36-ball fifty, Conway was struggling at the other end. It was Mohit with his slower ball into the wicket who provided the first breakthrough in the 11th over. Dube perished for 1 in an attempt to up the ante. Rahane and Rayudu hit one six each but they too fell trying to increase the scoring rate. Jadeja's cameo and Moeen's six in the final over ensured that CSK crossed 170.

But the idea is to keep our process the same. Assessing the pitch and deciding our approach is important. This time my approach has been to play expressive cricket. Earlier I used to take my time for 10-odd balls. A lot depends on situation and pitch as well. Left-right combo is important. Opposition tactics change because of that. Like bowling an off-spinner or a left-arm spinner. Devon was playing fast bowlers well, but he's also played spin very well throughout the season.",

Lot to play for as IPL 2023 reaches the home stretch with today's Qualifier 1. The Titans cruised through the league phase once again and were comfortably the best team on display, they just didn't confirm their place in the playoffs, but they did so emphatically. On the other hand, the Super Kings had to wait until their final game of the league, but they do have the knack of winning big moments, especially when playing at home. The winner of tonight's game will go through to Sunday's final while the loser will wait for tomorrow's winner in QF 2 on 26th in Ahmedabad. CSK not just have home advantage tonight, but they're the better rested team, having played their last league match on Saturday. On the other hand, Titans's last match spilled into the wee hours of yesterday and they'd to travel as well. Would that be a telling factor today?",

    "commText": "B0$ by B1$ \\n \\nMS Dhoni and Chennai Super Kings have already done their lap of honour around Chepauk and said their thank yous to the fans. The 2023 season began with the possibility of their demigod of 16 years walking away into the sunset after two months. Each of the seven games at home since represented a cathartic reunion, a celebration and just a grand display of gratitude and reverence for the man who put the team on the highest pedestal of success over the years, and made it to the massive mural at the venue. \\n \\nTuesday presents the CSK faithful one last chance this season to raise the roof as the team attempts to make a swift entry to what will be their 10th final appearance, and eventually try to match Mumbai Indians for the number of the IPL titles won. \\n \\nGujarat Titans however, have no time for such emotional storylines. Just a night ago, Hardik Pandya fielded a full strength side even as his team were confirmed to play the first qualifier, and preached the need to maintain good habits and momentum. The cut-throat decision ended in heartbreak for another of India's favourite sons as Virat Kohli sunk into his chair in complete despair late on Sunday night following RCB's league stage ouster. GT were on-brand with the ruthless approach, as it has enabled them to be the only side that has maintained distance from the traffic in the middle of the points table all season. \\n \\nAny concerns of fatigue due to the short turnaround time between their last league game and the first qualifier are also unfounded. In the first week of May, Pandya's team has played with a shorter gap between two matches - going from an evening fixture in Jaipur on a Friday, travelling back home on Saturday and featuring in the afternoon game on Sunday. And they didn't just turn up, they won that fixture. Any perceived advantage for CSK of playing at a venue where GT haven't this season is also negated by the fact that even they are not too sure about the conditions to expect, while Pandya's side has been excellent on the road with 6 away wins. \\n \\nThe high-stakes game will thus, come down to fine match-ups and finer margins between two teams that have shown identical tendencies to squeeze out every ounce of ability from the squads at their disposal. \\n \\nB2$Chennai Super Kings vs Gujarat Titans, May 23, 2023 at 07:30 PM IST \\n \\nB3$MA Chidambaram stadium, Chennai \\n \\nB4$A hot evening is in the offing where temperatures will hit the high 30s. The conditions at the venue suited batters early on but the wickets have slowed down as the tournament has progressed. It reflected in the scores made at the venue as the average 1st innings total came down from 182 in the first four games to 150 in the last three. CSK themselves were outspun in their last game there against KKR. \\n \\nTuesday's game however will be played on pitch #5, where CSK and PBKS played out a high-scoring entertainer where the home team's 200/4 was chased down on the last ball. \\n \\nB5$3-0 to GT. Three games (In 2022 and 2023), three venues (Pune, Mumbai and Ahmedabad), three successful run-chases for Hardik Pandya's side. \\n \\nB6$ \\n \\nB7$ \\n \\nB8$CSK have a clean bill of health and no other reported unavailabilities \\n \\nB9$With Deepak Chahar back to wicket-taking form in the PowerPlay, the early match-up between him and Shubman Gill will be crucial to the direction the game takes. Gill arrives with scores of 101 and 104* in his last game, and has scored 49 runs in the 37 balls he's faced from Chahar. The CSK pacer however, has dismissed him twice. \\n \\nThough Ajinkya Rahane has flattered to deceive in home games, he has an admirable record against Mohammed Shami - smashing 86 at a strike rate of 168.63 without getting dismissed. Against Hardik Pandya, Dhoni could turn to Ravindra Jadeja who has got the GT captain out twice in 16 balls and has given away just 18 runs. \\n \\nB10$Ruturaj Gaikwad, Devon Conway, Ajinkya Rahane, Ambati Rayudu, Shivam Dube, Moeen Ali, Ravindra Jadeja, MS Dhoni(c/wk), Deepak Chahar, Tushar Deshpande, Maheesh Theekshana (Impact sub: Matheesha Pathirana) \\n \\nB11$ \\n \\nB8$Vijay Shankar regained full fitness ahead of Sunday's league game against RCB and came in as an impact sub to bat at No.3. Considering Dasun Shanaka hasn't had a lot to do with both bat and ball, GT might turn to Joshua Little, in the XI or as the impact sub. The left-arm pacer, who was away for the Ireland-Bangladesh series, returned to the GT squad ahead of the weekend fixture against RCB. He also trained in Chennai on the eve of the first qualifier. \\n \\nB9$Ruturaj Gaikwad has hit 73, 53 and 92 against GT but Shami has found ways to put a lid on his scoring early on. The veteran pacer has conceded just 40 runs off the 59 balls he's bowled at the CSK opener. Shami has also been excellent against CSK's top-scorer this season - Devon Conway - dismissing him twice in eight deliveries he's bowled at him in the IPL. \\n \\nMohit Sharma, meanwhile, returns to the city where he made his name in this tournament with 16 wickets in 13 matches there. He has troubled Ambati Rayudu in this tournament, getting him out on six occasions in 43 balls and giving away just 52 runs. \\n \\nB10$Wriddhiman Saha (wk), Shubman Gill, Hardik Pandya (c), Sai Sudharsan/Vijay Shankar, David Miller, Rahul Tewatia, Rashid Khan, Noor Ahmad, Mohammed Shami, Mohit Sharma, Yash Dayal (Impact Sub: Joshua Little/Dasun Shanaka) \\n \\nB15$ \\n \\n- Gujarat Titans have the third-best run-tally in the death-overs this season [639], while losing the fewest wickets in the phase [23]. They also have the second-best tally of sixes in this period [48]. \\n \\n- Shivam Dube has an incredible strike rate of 175.93 against spin this season. Interestingly, he has hit only 3 fours against them but has tonked 20 sixes. \\n \\n- In each of their last five games, CSK have picked 3 wickets in the PowerPlay- Gujarat Titans have picked 24 wickets in the PowerPlay this season - 15 of those have been picked by Shami. \\n \\nB16$ \\n \\n\"In the first half of the IPL, I was missing out on those big ones. I was getting a lot of 40s and 50s. Thankfully, it's all working out for me in the business end of the IPL.\" - B17$ after scoring back-to-back centuries \\n \\n\"I think [for] death bowling, confidence is very important. Tushar has developed because he is able to execute under pressure, he has the confidence now. And when you keep playing the same players, it helps. I think the bowlers have also taken the responsibility, Pathirana is quite a natural at bowling at the death but Deshpande has really developed there.\" - B18$ on his death-bowling options this season.",
