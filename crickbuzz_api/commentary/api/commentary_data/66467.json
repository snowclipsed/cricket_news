But they might yet have a say in this playoffs race as they go to Mumbai next. RCB don't need to worry about that right now, with their destiny in their own hands. And what a night it's going to be at the Chinnaswamy against table-toppers Gujarat Titans. That will also be the final league match of the season. If they had lost today, CSK and LSG would've qualified. But as it stands, the three playoffs spots are still up for grabs. That's all from us here. This is Sagar Chawla signing off on behalf of Harish and Kumar Abhisekh Das. Goodnight!",

    "commText": "B0$ Quite special considering the magnitude of the game. Thought SRH got a very good score. Ball was gripping as well. We wanted a good solid start. Didn't expect to be 172/0. But that's how well Faf and me have played this season. Faf's been on a different level. I've had a quiet couple of games. The way I was hitting in the nets wasn't transitioning into the middle in the last 2-3 matches. Wanted to make an impact and my intent was to go after the bowlers from ball 1 - something I've done through the season. There was a dip but I wanted to pick my game up at the right time. Never look at past records (not great numbers against SRH). B1$ I don't give myself enough credit sometimes because I put myself under so much stress already. I don't care what anyone says on the outside. That's their opinion. When you're in that situation yourself, you know how to win games of cricket. I've done that over a long period of time. It's not like when I play I don't win games for my team. It's playing the situation that I take pride in. I've never been a guy who plays so many fancy shots - was having a chat with Aiden as well. We have to play 12 months of the year. B2$ When I can make an impact in an important game, it gives me confidence, it gives the team confidence. I think it's the tattoos (secret behind partnership with Faf). We almost have 900 runs together this season. B3$ Just an understanding of where the game is going and what needs to be done. Having an experienced guy who's captained at the international level - it's been a beautiful transition for us coming together for RCB at the top and making an impact. Crowd here was amazing today as well. Told Faf as well. Just felt like it was a home game for us. They were cheering for us, taking my name as well. I feel you can't create this. I haven't forced anyone to follow me or be inspired by me. I'm just myself on the field. I do everything on the field very honestly and I think that resonates with people. It's an amazing position to be in that you can provide happiness to so many people. That's something I love to see when they have a smile on their face when I perform.",

It allowed them the luxury of a couple of overs to get a hang of how much help the spinners were getting. But after that, even they weren't spared. Kohli was on fire and some of the shots he played left even Faf in awe. Not sure how much of a factor the dew was tonight. Faf said at the toss that the decision to bowl was partly because there was dew during their practice sessions. Whatever it was, it worked out brilliantly for RCB.

    "commText": "B0$ Quite special considering the magnitude of the game. Thought SRH got a very good score. Ball was gripping as well. We wanted a good solid start. Didn't expect to be 172/0. But that's how well Faf and me have played this season. Faf's been on a different level. I've had a quiet couple of games. The way I was hitting in the nets wasn't transitioning into the middle in the last 2-3 matches. Wanted to make an impact and my intent was to go after the bowlers from ball 1 - something I've done through the season. There was a dip but I wanted to pick my game up at the right time. Never look at past records (not great numbers against SRH). B1$ I don't give myself enough credit sometimes because I put myself under so much stress already. I don't care what anyone says on the outside. That's their opinion. When you're in that situation yourself, you know how to win games of cricket. I've done that over a long period of time. It's not like when I play I don't win games for my team. It's playing the situation that I take pride in. I've never been a guy who plays so many fancy shots - was having a chat with Aiden as well. We have to play 12 months of the year. B2$ When I can make an impact in an important game, it gives me confidence, it gives the team confidence. I think it's the tattoos (secret behind partnership with Faf). We almost have 900 runs together this season. B3$ Just an understanding of where the game is going and what needs to be done. Having an experienced guy who's captained at the international level - it's been a beautiful transition for us coming together for RCB at the top and making an impact. Crowd here was amazing today as well. Told Faf as well. Just felt like it was a home game for us. They were cheering for us, taking my name as well. I feel you can't create this. I haven't forced anyone to follow me or be inspired by me. I'm just myself on the field. I do everything on the field very honestly and I think that resonates with people. It's an amazing position to be in that you can provide happiness to so many people. That's something I love to see when they have a smile on their face when I perform.",

He was really hard to bowl to, the spinners and pacers if they were short, he punished them, hats off to him [on Klaasen]. Siraj all his four overs - I think he went for under 20 with not all assistance from the wicket and Parnell as well. We were one seamer short on that pitch and it did not spin that much in the first innings. When those guys are chasing, they know exactly what to do. They are such good players; the left-arm spin was from one end and they knew what to do from the other end. They cashed in when they got some pace on the ball. It will be nice to go back to our home fans, we had 5 games there and the crowd were roaring. It will be nice to take on the table-toppers with our players purring.",

Great knock from Faf and Virat. We had a look at some guys moving forward. Probably one less option in the powerplay. Kartik was put under pressure.

Hundred for Kohli, another brilliant knock from Faf, and job done! Heinrich Klaasen made a sensational hundred earlier in the evening, not one shot out of place, and everything leaving the bat like a rocket. But he ends up on the losing side. The two RCB openers paced it brilliantly, going really hard in the powerplay to get ahead of the rate. It allowed them the luxury of a couple of overs to get a hang of how much help the spinners were getting. But after that, even they weren't spared. Kohli was on fire and some of the shots he played left even Faf in awe. Not sure how much of a factor the dew was tonight. Faf said at the toss that the decision to bowl was partly because there was dew during their practice sessions. Whatever it was, it worked out brilliantly for RCB. It's Gujarat Titans next at the Chinnaswamy and what a game that promises to be with a playoffs spot on the line for the hosts.",

The others just had to bat around him and did not do a great job of it it must be said. But what an innings from the ginger-bearded South African. RCB missed a trick by not bowling pace at him more often and he made them pay. Such clean striking against the spinners and his hitting of the ball was sight to watch. Shahbaz and Karn were taken apart and Faf did not go to Bracewell despite the offie taking 2 wickets in his first over.

    "commText": "B0$ \\n \\nUnlike in a season of football around the world, IPL offers no real easy, lopsided fixture. It's just the nature of the sport and the quality - on paper, at the very least - across the 10 teams. Yet, RCB should head to Hyderabad with renewed hope knowing that they take on a side that has struggled for cohesion all season and whose campaign has already come to a disappointing and premature end. \\n \\nThe renewed hope also stems from RCB's statement win over Rajasthan Royals from three nights ago that hit two birds with one stone for Faf du Plessis's side - dent a fellow top-four aspirant and gain a massive NRR boost. A win on Thursday will take RCB to 14 points and give them the advantage of knowing what exactly they need to do next to make it through to the playoffs as their last game is the final league game of the season. Long story, short - the ball is still very much in their court. \\n \\nFor all to go to plan, RCB need a bright start with the ball. They have the worst ER in the middle and the death overs but are effective in the first six, having picked the most wickets in that phase this season (30). They could truly dictate terms with consistency in this period as SRH have been shaky starters, with the second worst run rate in the batting PowerPlay, and the least boundary count (85 - 74 fours, 11 sixes). A lot of such numbers for SRH flatter to deceive because of how their overall season has been - massively underwhelming. Head coach Brian Lara has rued the multiple defeats they've endured from clearly winnable scenarios, and the fact that the team missed being much higher on the points table. That ship has now sailed, but even when there's nothing to play for, they could derail RCB's campaign and strive to avoid the ignominy of earning the wooden spoon. \\n \\n \\nB1$ Sunrisers Hyderabad vs Royal Challengers Bangalore, May 18, 2023, 07:30 PM IST \\n \\nB2$ Rajiv Gandhi International Cricket Stadium, Hyderabad \\n \\nB3$ Batting at this venue has felt like a chore for teams, with a combined batting average (runs/dismissal) of 23.71, the second lowest this season. Teams batting first have won four of the six games at this venue. \\n \\nB4$ SRH have won 12 of the 21 fixtures played between the two sides, including the final of the 2016 season which was played in Bangalore. In Hyderabad, RCB have won just once in 7 outings. SRH, however, have been woeful at home this season - winning just 1 in six. \\n \\nB5$ \\n \\nB6$ \\n \\nB7$ None reported. \\n \\nB8$ Bhuvneshwar Kumar comes into the fixture on the back of a five-wicket haul, which included four wickets in the final over. Against RCB however, SRH will need him to make an impact at the opposite end as he matches up well against the famed troika - Virat Kohli (63 balls | 75 runs | 3 dismissals), Faf du Plessis (57 balls | 70 runs | 1 dismissal) and Glenn Maxwell (32 balls | 39 runs | 2 dismissals). \\n \\nB9$ Anmolpreet Singh, Abhishek Sharma, Rahul Tripathi, Aiden Markram (c), Heinrich Klaasen, Glenn Phillips/Harry Brook, Abdul Samad, Bhuvneshwar Kumar, T Natarajan, Mayank Markande, Fazalhaq Farooqi/Marco Jansen \\n \\nB10$ \\n \\nB7$ None reported. \\n \\nB8$ Glenn Maxwell in the middle-overs has to be the menace for SRH. He strikes at 160.77 and averages 41.57 against leg spinners this season and should be the batter to take on Mayank Markande - who has 10 wickets in 6 outings in Hyderabad. \\n \\nB9$ Virat Kohli, Faf du Plessis (c), Glenn Maxwell, Mahipal Lomror, Dinesh Karthik (wk), Michael Bracewell, Anuj Rawat, Wayne Parnell, Karn Sharma, Harshal Patel, Mohammed Siraj \\n \\nB14$ \\n \\n- Heinrich Klaasen has the highest strike rate against spin this season - 180.95 \\n \\n-Mohammed Siraj has picked 9 wickets in the PowerPlay (joint-second best with Trent Boult) and conceded runs at just 6.31 in that phase. \\n \\nWhat they said: \\n \\n\"A lot of pride for us to play for [in the last two games]. We'll try to give some opportunities if we're allowed to. It'll be nice to finish off the tournament in good spirits but unfortunately, we haven't been good enough in the tournament this year.\" - B15$ \\n \\n\"Really good for our NRR [win over RR]... hopefully, we can set it up for the last game at the Chinnaswamy.\" - B16$",
