In the 10 over mark, the message me and Kyle sent out was 160 would be a good total on this track, they have some good bowlers as well who exploited the conditions. We fell 10 short but made up with the ball. And there was no dew so made it fair for both teams. We game in here yesterday and saw 180 would be a par score, but the first over from Boult, me and Kyle had a chat and realised this isn't a 180 wicket. The ball was keeping a bit low, so we gave ourselves time in the powerplay. Maybe if we played a bit better, we might have got 170 as well. I think that run-out from the impact player (Mishra), and two wickets falling back to back gives the oppostion (his own team) a chance. We know with Rajasthan their strength is their top four, so we needed to have our plans in place to get them out.",

With the batting line-up we have, it was a very chaseable score. But they bowled really well, used the conditions really well. (Conditions) Personally I was expecting something like this, bit of slow and low kind of wicket is what I expected and we got that. You need to play some smart cricket and we did that till the ninth over. Right after Jaiswal got out, it was a matter of getting that one big partnership. They bowled really well, whenever we tried to go hard at them, I think we lost wickets. 5 overs 50 in this kind of wicket is a bit tough with the way they were bowling. Even if you win or lose a game, you take lessons out of it, that's the beauty of this game. We'll be taking lot of lessons out of it. We did a reasonably good job to restrict them to 150. There are lots of lessons in the bowling side as well and in the batting also. We expect much better performance and we all know the standard of cricket we've been playing.

    "commText": "B0$ A nice reminder from the IPL that these 150 sort of games can also be really thrilling. Today was a much more even contest between ball and bat, as the pitch favoured the bowlers by being a bit two paced. Rajasthan Royals started the chase nicely, as they got to 47 without losing a wicket at the end of the powerplay. In fact, they didn't lose a wicket till the 12th over, as both openers got into their thirties. But then LSG unleashed Marcus Stoinis with the ball for the first time, and he proved to be the game changer. Stoinis got the wickets of both set RR openers, sandwiched between an avoidable Samson run-out. With those three quick wickets, boundaries totally dried up as LSG began to exert pressure. Shimron Hetmyer couldn't pull off any heroics this time, and Padikkal and Riyan Parag tried very hard at the end to get the game exciting, but perhaps ate up too many balls in trying to get set. Naveen-ul-Haq was the standout bowler for LSG, who despite not picking a wicket was incredibly economical, conceding just 19 off his four overs. In the final over, Avesh held his nerve to get the visitors home, alas no winning return for the Royals at the Sawai Mansingh Stadium...",

In the 10 over mark, the message me and Kyle sent out was 160 would be a good total on this track, they have some good bowlers as well who exploited the conditions. We fell 10 short but made up with the ball. And there was no dew so made it fair for both teams. We game in here yesterday and saw 180 would be a par score, but the first over from Boult, me and Kyle had a chat and realised this isn't a 180 wicket. The ball was keeping a bit low, so we gave ourselves time in the powerplay. Maybe if we played a bit better, we might have got 170 as well. I think that run-out from the impact player (Mishra), and two wickets falling back to back gives the oppostion (his own team) a chance. We know with Rajasthan their strength is their top four, so we needed to have our plans in place to get them out.",

They bowled really well, whenever we tried to go hard at them, I think we lost wickets. 5 overs 50 in this kind of wicket is a bit tough with the way they were bowling. Even if you win or lose a game, you take lessons out of it, that's the beauty of this game. We'll be taking lot of lessons out of it. We did a reasonably good job to restrict them to 150.

    "commText": "B0$ A nice reminder from the IPL that these 150 sort of games can also be really thrilling. Today was a much more even contest between ball and bat, as the pitch favoured the bowlers by being a bit two paced. Rajasthan Royals started the chase nicely, as they got to 47 without losing a wicket at the end of the powerplay. In fact, they didn't lose a wicket till the 12th over, as both openers got into their thirties. But then LSG unleashed Marcus Stoinis with the ball for the first time, and he proved to be the game changer. Stoinis got the wickets of both set RR openers, sandwiched between an avoidable Samson run-out. With those three quick wickets, boundaries totally dried up as LSG began to exert pressure. Shimron Hetmyer couldn't pull off any heroics this time, and Padikkal and Riyan Parag tried very hard at the end to get the game exciting, but perhaps ate up too many balls in trying to get set. Naveen-ul-Haq was the standout bowler for LSG, who despite not picking a wicket was incredibly economical, conceding just 19 off his four overs. In the final over, Avesh held his nerve to get the visitors home, alas no winning return for the Royals at the Sawai Mansingh Stadium...",

    "commText": "B0$ A very strange innings from Lucknow Super Giants! Boult was brilliant with the new ball for Rajasthan offering no freebies in the powerplay. Sandeep too kept the lid on the scoring rate. Both the LSG openers struggled to get going and captain KL Rahul was dropped twice inside five overs. They did get a couple of big overs scoring 13 and 18 off the eighth and ninth over respectively. But RR pulled it back again. Holder had KL caught at long-on with a slower delivery and the move to promote Badoni didn't work as Boult nipped him out to finish with impressive figures of 1/16. Ashwin picked two wickets in an over and LSG's score was just 104/4 at the end of the 14th over. Pooran and Stoinis had to go big but RR were pretty much spot-on with the ball. Holder conceded 17 runs off the 19th over but Sandeep bowled a terrific final over. This is a two-paced track but 154 is clearly below-par. Despite being 79/0 after 10 overs, LSG strangely didn't use the services of Stoinis and Pooran wisely. How will the hosts go about their business in the chase? Join us in a bit to find out...",

Their four main batters - Mayers, KL Rahul, Pooran and Stoinis - have scored at least one half-ton this season. While the three overseas batsmen have strike-rates in excess of 150, the others have struggled in that aspect. Deepak Hooda is yet to make an impact, he's been\u00a0dismissed in single digits in his last 4 outings and has bowled just one over. In the bowling department, Yudhvir Singh Charak had a dream debut but Avesh Khan and Unadkat have been\u00a0expensive. Lucknow might have erred with some of their tactics against PBKS but they'll be keen to get back to winning ways.\u00a0",

    "commText": "B0$  \\n \\nOn a hot late afternoon in Jaipur, Nicholas Pooran was among the earliest to center-wicket practice. It mustn't have been easy out there, padding up in 37 degrees heat and going all out with the range-hitting. Pooran's fellow colleagues from Lucknow Super Giants and Rajasthan Royals joined him much later, when the sun went down and the conditions were easier in the middle. But for the security personnel manning the Sawai Mansingh Stadium, the job just got a whole lot more challenging. \"Halla Bol\", or \"raise your voice\", no longer remained a team tagline. Everybody wanted a closer shot of their favourite cricketers; the IPL was in town after all. \\n \\nJaipur is among the last two cities to hold the tournament this year, and is certainly the home base that's endured the longest wait to welcome its team in this post-lockdown world. Perhaps no one captured the sentiment better than Yuzvendra Chahal who has been around the team for a season and a half now. \"Sir ye mera toh debut hai Rajasthan ke liye yahan pe,\" the legspinner quipped when asked about the home advantage in Jaipur. \\n \\nFor RR, it feels like a good time to come back home too. They are on a three-match winning streak and have just handed defeat to an opponent they just didn't have the measure of last year. And now sitting atop the points table, they meet a side they beat twice in two attempts last season and whom they will be hosting for the very first time in Jaipur. That's how fresh this encounter is going to be. \\n \\nNo team at the moment will perhaps be happier with an away win than LSG, given the fickle conditions back home in Lucknow. Everyone's aware of RR's strong numbers but KL Rahul and Co. would feel they've a chance to catch the hosts unawares at a venue they've taken their time to come back to. After all, what was once a \"fortress\" has struggled to even capture all of the home games in recent times. So expect Jaipur to make the most of what's on its plate, and if it means a bit of fanfare at the practice session then so be it. \\n \\nB1$  RR vs LSG, Match 26, IPL 2023 at 7:30 PM local \\n \\nB2$ Sawai Mansingh Stadium, Jaipur \\n \\nB3$ Red and pink everywhere in Jaipur except on the square in the middle. There are eight black-soil pitches at the venue and the three of them in the center have been prepared for this IPL season. The match will be played on pitch #4 which, on a closer look, looked dry underneath and a layer of grass has been left to keep the surface together. The only T20I played here threw up middling totals in the 160s and it got harder and harder to bat as the match progressed. R Ashwin had observed how the ball spun more the slower he bowled. There has been consistent dew in the evenings here and the curator expects more of the same during the match too. \\n \\nThe ground, one of the smallest capacity cricket stadiums in India, sports a rather big playing area with roughly 70m boundaries all around. Chahal pointed out how he was looking to bowl here as a spinner. \\n \\nB4$  \\n \\nB5$  \\n \\nB6$  It will be interesting to see if RR continue to back Riyan Parag. The 21-year-old has returned scores of 7, 20, 7 and 5 this season. \\n \\nB7$  Nicholas Pooran's average against spin in IPL drops from 42 to 24 when he's facing offspin, and the SR takes a hit by 20 points. R Ashwin would be itching to bowl to the left-handed power-hitter. \\n \\nB8$  Jos Buttler, Yashasvi Jaiswal, Sanju Samson(w/c), Riyan Parag, Shimron Hetmyer, Dhruv Jurel, Ravichandran Ashwin, Trent Boult, Adam Zampa, Sandeep Sharma, Yuzvendra Chahal \\n \\nB9$  \\n \\nB10$ Kyle Mayers continues to keep Quinton de Kock out. Will something give way in Jaipur? Yudhvir Singh Charak had a dream debut in the last game and is likely to keep his place but LSG would also be keen to find a place for Amit Mishra. \\n \\nB7$  In IPL since 2018, Jos Buttler averages a shade under 29 against legspin and has been dismissed nine times to them. In Ravi Bishnoi and/or Amit Mishra, LSG have the personnel to take the RR opener on. \\n \\nB12$ KL Rahul(c), Kyle Mayers/Quinton de Kock, Deepak Hooda, Marcus Stoinis, Krunal Pandya, Nicholas Pooran(w), Ayush Badoni, Avesh Khan, Yudhvir Singh Charak, Mark Wood, Ravi Bishnoi \\n \\nB13$  \\n \\n- In Jaipur, Buttler averages 54.25 and scores his runs at a SR of 143. He has four fifties here with a high score of 95*. \\n \\n- Marcus Stoinis has gotten the better of Sanju Samson twice in the 12 balls he's bowled to him. \\n \\nB14$  \\n \\n\"We have a very strong team and we are placed second. It will be a nice battle against the top-placed RR\" - Yudhvir Singh Charak \\n \\n\"It's a big ground, so as a spinner I am very happy here... I, Ashwin and Zampa have played together in the last two games and we have a good bonding among ourselves\" - Yuzvendra Chahal",
