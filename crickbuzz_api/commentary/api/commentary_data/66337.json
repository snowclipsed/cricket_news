    "commText": "B0$ \\n \\nWhile the heated exchange between Gautam Gambhir and Virat Kohli turned the limelight away from the game itself, the fact remains that Lucknow Super Giants have been a disappointing side at their home ground. Having failed to get over the line in a low-scoring game against Royal Challengers Bangalore, the Super Giants suffered their third loss at home on the trot and will have their work cut out when Chennai Super Kings, known for their acumen on tracks that have been on the slower side, come visiting. \\n \\nIn the past two matches at the Ekana Cricket Stadium, LSG have failed to chase down targets of 136 and 127, with their overseas contingent especially having struggled here. Apart from the 38-ball 73 scored by Kyle Mayers in the opening game against Delhi Capitals, there hasn't been much to speak about in terms of contributions from the foreign players who have not been able to adapt to the pitches here. Even the Indian batters, barring KL Rahul, have not made much of an impact, which leaves the team still searching for answers with two home games remaining. \\n \\nMeanwhile, the Super Kings will feel more at home in Lucknow with a bowling attack capable of sucking all the momentum out of the opposition's innings. While they need to improve in the powerplay and the death, the middle overs are CSK's favourite period of play and they would certainly enjoy such a wicket compared to what they got back at home in Chepauk as spin, going against expectations, did not play a major role in most of their matches. With a batting department that has been working smoothly, and having bowlers who can get the best out of sluggish pitches, CSK will be entering the game as favourites, more so with Rahul being an unlikely starter after picking up a hip-flexor injury in the last game. \\n \\nB1$ Wednesday, May 3, at 15:30 IST \\n \\nB2$ Bharat Ratna Shri Atal Bihari Vajpayee Ekana Cricket Stadium, Lucknow \\n \\nB3$ Another low-scoring game. In the previous afternoon game at this venue, the Titans defended 135 despite LSG having scored more than 100 in the first 14 overs. Teams batting first have won three of the five matches played here. But thunderstorms have been forecast during the match time, which could lead to a curtailed game. Hence, bat or bowl will be a vexing issue for the captain winning the toss. \\n \\nB4$ The two teams have a 1-1 record in their face-offs so far. LSG chased down a target of 211 in their first meeting in 2022 while CSK defended 217 at Chepauk this year, keeping LSG to 205. \\n \\nB5$ \\n \\nB6$ \\n \\nRahul's injury might force LSG to strengthen their batting base by bringing in Quinton de Kock, who is yet to play a game this season. Should the South African wicketkeeper-batter make the cut, Naveen-ul-Haq could make way and Avesh Khan could be brought back into the eleven. LSG will also miss the services of Jaydev Unadkat who suffered an elbow injury during practice ahead of the game against RCB, tripping over a string attached to the nets, and was sent to Mumbai for scans. \\n \\nB7$ Amit Mishra and Krunal Pandya could be effective against both Ajinkya Rahane and Ambati Rayudu. Mishra has dismissed Rahane and Rayudu three times apiece while Krunal has dismissed these two twice each, and the two CSK batters have a strike rate of under 120 against the two spinners. \\n \\nB8$ Quinton de Kock (wk), Kyle Mayers, Deepak Hooda, Marcus Stoinis, Krunal Pandya, Nicholas Pooran, Ayush Badoni, Krishnappa Gowtham, Ravi Bishnoi, Avesh Khan, Amit Mishra. Impact sub - Yash Thakur. \\n \\nB9$ \\n \\nIt is still unclear if Ben Stokes, who has been recovering from an injury, is fit for the game. CSK, who have been unchanged for the past few games, might stick to the same combination. \\n \\nB7$ Nicholas Pooran averages 22.8 and has a strike rate of 117.53 against spinners who turn the ball away from him. Moeen Ali and Maheesh Theekshana make effective match-ups against the West Indian left-hander. CSK could also use the two spinners against de Kock (if he plays), as the South African averages only 20.33 and has a strike rate of 102.09 against away turners. Pooran, meanwhile, has scored 42 runs off 20 deliveries against Jadeja and CSK will look to avoid using his left-arm spin when the batter is around. \\n \\nB8$ Ruturaj Gaikwad, Devon Conway, Ajinkya Rahane, Moeen Ali, Ambati Rayudu, Shivam Dube, Ravindra Jadeja, MS Dhoni (c & wk), Matheesha Pathirana, Tushar Deshpande, Maheesh Theekshana. Impact sub - Akash Singh. \\n \\nB12$ \\n \\n- Among those with a minimum of 500 runs in the IPL, Devon Conway has the best average (51.23). He has struck 666 runs in 16 matches, with eight half-centuries. Five of those fifties have come in his last six appearances. \\n \\n- The average first innings score in Lucknow is 151 while it dips to 126 in the second innings. Ruturaj Gaikwad, who represents Maharashtra in domestic cricket, has scored two fifties in three outings at this venue and has a SR of 148.30. \\n \\nB13$ \\n \\n\"He doesn't always look that good on the eye and other times he looks exquisite. He is just a player who gets the job done. He's found a good method. Spin, there was a little bit of a question mark. There always is when an overseas player comes to the subcontinent for the first time. But I think he's got a game that actually plays very well against spin. He has a good strike rate and he can access the boundary and over the boundary. So we are really happy with Devon's contributions.\" B14$, CSK head coach, on Devon",
