But the amount of love and affection I have been shown wherever I have been this year, B1$ A lot depends on the body, I have 6-7 months to decide. It will be more like a gift from my side, it's not easy for me but that's a gift. B2$You do get emotional simply because it's the last part of my career, it started over here and the first game when I walked down everyone was chanting my name. My eyes were full of water and I just stood there in the dugout for a while. I realised I want to enjoy this. It was the same thing in Chennai, it was my last game over there but B3$ They love me for what I am. The kind of cricket I play, I think everyone in the stadium thinks they can play that way because there is nothing orthodox about it. So I feel they can relate to me more than anyone else. I don't want to change myself, I never wanted to portray myself in a way which I am not. I just keep it simple. Every trophy is special, but what is special about IPL is every crunch game you need to be ready. That's something we have done, there were lapses today, the bowling department didn't work, but it was the batting department that took the pressure off them today. I do get frustrated, it is human but I try to step into their shoes, every individual deals with pressure differently. Ajinkya and a few others are experienced, so you don't worry a lot about them. If anyone is confused, then can always ask. The special thing about Rayudu is he will always give his 100% when he is on his field. But with him in the team, I will never win the Fairplay Award. He always wants to contribute and he has been a fantastic cricketer. I've been playing with him for a long time, since the India A tours. He's a player who can play spin and pace equally well. It is something really special. I felt he would do something really special, I'm really happy for him. This game will be one he will remember, he's also like me - not someone who uses the phone often. What's important is that he has had a fantastic career and I hope he enjoys the next phase of his life...",

It will be more like a gift from my side, it's not easy for me but that's a gift. B2$You do get emotional simply because it's the last part of my career, it started over here and the first game when I walked down everyone was chanting my name. My eyes were full of water and I just stood there in the dugout for a while. I realised I want to enjoy this. It was the same thing in Chennai, it was my last game over there but B3$ They love me for what I am. The kind of cricket I play, I think everyone in the stadium thinks they can play that way because there is nothing orthodox about it. So I feel they can relate to me more than anyone else. I don't want to change myself, I never wanted to portray myself in a way which I am not. I just keep it simple. Every trophy is special, but what is special about IPL is every crunch game you need to be ready. That's something we have done, there were lapses today, the bowling department didn't work, but it was the batting department that took the pressure off them today. I do get frustrated, it is human but I try to step into their shoes, every individual deals with pressure differently. Ajinkya and a few others are experienced, so you don't worry a lot about them. If anyone is confused, then can always ask. The special thing about Rayudu is he will always give his 100% when he is on his field. But with him in the team, I will never win the Fairplay Award. He always wants to contribute and he has been a fantastic cricketer. I've been playing with him for a long time, since the India A tours. He's a player who can play spin and pace equally well. It is something really special. I felt he would do something really special, I'm really happy for him. This game will be one he will remember, he's also like me - not someone who uses the phone often. What's important is that he has had a fantastic career and I hope he enjoys the next phase of his life...",

It was Conway who was the more aggressive, taking down Shami and Hardik in the powerplay. The introduction of Noor Ahmad got GT the wickets, as he dismissed both openers in the same over. It looked like the scoring rate would slow down, but out walked Ajinkya Rahane who smoked two classy sixes off Josh Little. He then got two boundaries against Rashid, while his partner Dube struggled to find his timing. Dube finally found his gear in the final Rashid Khan over, hitting him for two sixes and getting CSK back in the contest. Rayudu was the next CSK batter to be a hero, he was the only one to pick Mohit Sharma's slower ones and slam it over the boundary ropes. Rayudu fell and then Dhoni was out first ball. Mohit Sharma then delivered almost the perfect last over, nailing four yorkers but then Sir Jadeja decided he'll have the final laugh, finishing the game off with a six and a four to eternalize his place in CSK folklore.

    "commText": "B0$ GT would be extremely happy that they have scored 214 in a grand finale! Runs on board in such pressure games can always prove to be telling and the home side definitely have the upper hand heading into the break. It was very unlike CSK tonight as they missed catches and run out opportunities in numbers and that can turn out to be a big factor. Even the ground fielding from them was ordinary and they gave away some free runs. Chahar dropped Gill on 2, it was literally a dolly. After that, 30 runs came off the 3rd and 4th over combined. That gave GT the momentum they were searching for. Jadeja fumbled a relatively easy opportunity to run Saha out but did outfox Gill with a beauty in the same over. Saha went on to score a Fifty but the real game changer was Sudharsan tonight. He batted on a different level and kept finding the boundaries at will. He missed out on a ton but the young man did remarkably well. Pathirana finished strong but the damage was already done by then. The bowling was off the mark for CSK. Chasing a target over 200 in an IPL final is a mammoth task. Can CSK pull it off? The highest total that has been chased in an IPL final was 200 by KKR against Punjab in 2014. GT will fancy their chances. Join us in a while for the run chase...",
