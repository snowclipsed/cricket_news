While he was batting I was talking to him and he was saying 'keep playing, keep playing' and he was giving me confidence. He told me, 'If both of us bat till the 15th-16th over, we can finish the game even early.' And that's what we did. The previous game which I played against CSK, I played a scoop.

You need to say 200 is a good score (to motivate the players), needed to make sure you take the pace off. They capitalized the first 6 overs with the pace on. He (SKY) is one of the best, when he gets going, it's difficult to shut him down. Siraj has been fantastic in the first half of IPL.

Kishan got MI off to a flier and set the tone. Hasaranga applied the brakes and picked up Kishan and Rohit in the same over. Nehal and SKY joined hands post that. Then there was clinical decimation. Everyone went to the cleaners. No one was spared. Nehal started off aggressively. But once SKY started, everyone took a back seat and just soaked in some amazing display of batting. RCB bowlers did help MI a little as well with their poor wayward bowling. Earlier, Faf and Maxi had played fine knocks to help put RCB 199 on the board. And has been the case in this tourney, RCB failed to put the finishing touches while batting. They could have scored 20 more but lost wickets at regular intervals in the last 7 overs. MI have jumped to number 3 in the table. RCB have slipped to 7. Their NRR hasn't been helped by this game as well. MI improve their own NRR but it is still in the negative.

Everyone went to the cleaners. No one was spared. Nehal started off aggressively. But once SKY started, everyone took a back seat and just soaked in some amazing display of batting. RCB bowlers did help MI a little as well with their poor wayward bowling. Earlier, Faf and Maxi had played fine knocks to help put RCB 199 on the board. And has been the case in this tourney, RCB failed to put the finishing touches while batting. They could have scored 20 more but lost wickets at regular intervals in the last 7 overs. MI have jumped to number 3 in the table. RCB have slipped to 7. Their NRR hasn't been helped by this game as well. MI improve their own NRR but it is still in the negative.

The Australian pacer should have had Faf as well for a golden duck but Nehal Wadhera dropped a catch at mid-wicket. That turned out to be a costly drop as the RCB captain and Glenn Maxwell counterattacked. Both the overseas players notched up their fifties and the duo stitched their fourth 100+ stand of the season. Bangalore were 131/2 at the end of the 12th over and would have eyed a mammoth total but Mumbai fought back. They picked three wickets in three overs which included the scalps of both the set batters. DK scored a quickfire 30 but RCB failed to cross the 200-run mark. The winner goes third on the points table. Who'll come out on top? Promises to be a cracking duel. Join us in a bit for the chase...",

    "commText": "B0$ by B1$ \\n \\nMumbai Indians vs Royal Challengers Bangalore has been one of the most anticipated games of the IPL 2023 at the Wankhede and no surprise there that it will be a full house on Tuesday night. In popularity charts the marquee contest would go down as the second-most high-profile match-up of the season in the city, the first, of course, is the one against Chennai Super Kings, which has already been played. \\n \\nWith both teams on even keel on the points table, the star-studded match gains extra significance and no doubt it could rise to the levels of intensity that is expected at the business-end of the competition. Both would be trying to wriggle out of the mid-table muddle. \\n \\nOn the eve of the game, there are some troubling questions for hosts Mumbai Indians with avoidable scrutiny on Rohit Sharma. The captain's continued poor run in the season was the immediate point of debate, leaving ephemerally aside the more important assignments - the World Test Championship and the World Cup - in the longer run. \\n \\nJust 184 runs in 10 games and the 40th position among top scorers' list of the IPL 2023 are not worthy of the batter that he has been. More prominently, he has just two half centuries in 33 IPL games. Further dissection points to only two scores of over 50 runs in the last three IPL seasons. \\n \\nThe perception is that the extended poor form of the skipper may be affecting his leadership and not too long ago, an expert no less than Sunil Gavaskar called for him to take a break. Rohit has not exactly followed that advice but he changed his batting order from the top of the line-up and pushed himself down to No 3 in the previous game. But with very little success. \\n \\nA skipper in a happy space puts the team too in a happy space and Rohit's form may be reflecting on the points table for MI - 10 points from 10 games and the sixth place. That is a precarious position for a team that has won the IPL five times. But the team said it is fully behind the off-colour skipper. \\n \\n\"Absolutely not (worried about his form). A legend that Rohit is, especially with Mumbai and everything that he has done in his career, we actually back him. He could come back into the form any time. So far, he has batted beautifully in a few games, showing really good tempo at the top, so we are absolutely backing him.,\" Cameron Green, who opened in place Rohit in the previous game said of the beleaguered skipper who would know that he needs to fire for the franchise on Tuesday night to win the vital game and move up in the points table. \\n \\nLike MI, Royal Challengers Bangalore too are coming to the contest on the back of a defeat but they may, nevertheless, be having a slight edge over the home team. With key batsmen - Virat Kohli and Faf du Plessis - among runs and Mahipal Lomror also joining the party, RCB could be in a happy space. They would be expecting more meaty contributions from Dinesh Karthik as well as Maxwell. \\n \\nTheir bowling has got the added firepower in the form of Josh Hazlewood, who combines well with Mohammed Siraj and Wanindu Hasaranga, who have done well for the franchise so far. But with the Impact Player rule, this has largely been a batsmen's season and the bowlers, more often than not, have been sent to cleaners. The script is unlikely to be different on Tuesday night. \\n \\nKedar Jadhav felt the same. \"The impact player rule has made the teams and players braver and fearless. They have an extra batter as a cushion, so obviously they are expressing more and instead of 180 there are more totals above 200,\" the latest entrant to RCB said on the eve of the game. \\n \\nB2$ Tuesday, May 9, 2023 at 19:30 IST \\n \\nB3$ Wankhede Stadium, Mumbai \\n \\nB4$ The bounce on offer tends to work in favour of the stroke-makers while the likes of Josh Hazlewood might too find something to their liking. The ground has seen many a high-scoring game already in the season, and the batters are likely to relish the prospect of the conditions as well as the ground-size. \\n \\nB5$ \\n \\nB6$ \\n \\nB7$ Jofra Archer was taken down by RCB's openers the last time these two faced off in the season, but it remains a match-up particularly against Faf du Plessis who he has dismissed twice in 22 balls. The other match-up would be that between Piyush Chawla and Glenn Maxwell. The latter has only single-digit scores in away games so far but the conditions at Wankhede could suit his style of play. Against Chawla, there could be fireworks one way or another. He has been dismissed three times in 36 balls but has a strike-rate of 150 against the spinner. \\n \\nB8$ Tilak Varma, one of the main contributors with the bat for Mumbai this season, is expected to feature in the XI after having missed the last game vs CSK. The big point, however, is whether Rohit open the batting or will he play at No 3, like in the last game. \\n \\nB9$ Ishan Kishan, Cameron Green, Rohit Sharma, Suryakumar Yadav, Tilak Varma, Tim David, Nehal Wadhera, Jofra Archer, Piyush Chawla, Kumar Kartikeya, Arshad Khan \\n \\nB10$ \\n \\nB7$ Fad and Kohli have nine fifties between them at Wankhede and come into this game on the back of some imperious form. They could be targeted early by MI with spin, from Chawla. With the ball RCB might be looking at the Harshal vs Rohit match-up, with the bowler having gotten him thrice in 22 balls. They'd also be hoping for Hasaranga to join the party at the venue where he's picked up a five-fer previously. \\n \\nB8$ Karn Sharma may make way for a batsman in the RCB line-up or come in as an Impact Player. Kedar Jadhav, the late entrant to the Bengaluru squad, should retain his place in the side. \\n \\nB9$ Faf du Plessis, Virat Kohli, Mahipal Lomror, Glenn Maxwell, Suyash Prabhudesai/Anuj Rawat, Kedar Jadhav, Dinesh Karthik, Wanindu Hasaranga, Harshal Patel, Josh Hazlewood, Mohammad Siraj \\n \\nB14$ \\n \\n- Harshal Patel has 21 wickets in just 12 outings against Mumbai Indians in the IPL \\n \\n- Suryakumar Yadav has a strike-rate of 200 against Mohammad Siraj \\n \\nB15$ \\n \\nOur discussions have been to play the same way, be aggressive in the powerplay. The message from the coaching staff is to show the same intent. We've got some incredibly experienced guys, especially around me at the top. We've got Ishan and Rohit, who play for India. We've got SKY after me, so there are a lot of good cricket brains going around. I have had an incredible experience. Mumbai has treated me beautifully. Hopefully I can replay the faith - Cameron Green, MI all-rounder \\n \\nThat is the tagline of RCB is to play bold. I think it came from only Virat Kohli. He has a strong personality, likes to lead from the front. Whatever it is, batting or bowling, he wants to contribute in winning games whichever teams he plays for. It definitely rubs off on the team. The players want to perform close to that level, or close to that intensity he brings in, in his batting or when he is practising - Kedar Jadhav, RCB batsman",
