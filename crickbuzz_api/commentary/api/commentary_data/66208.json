A near-perfect IPL recipe, if one can put it that way. Whose turn will it be tonight? Join us for the clash between KKR and RCB from the Eden Gardens in a few hours' time.

Our bowlers used the variations on a high-scoring wicket and I thought we did well to restrict them to 197. Jos wasn't fully fit (injured his finger while taking the catch), the thinking behind keeping Padikkal (in the middle order) was to tackle their two spinners in the middle overs. The coaches have put a lot of work behind him (on Dhruv Jurel), we had a work week camp before the IPL, but the way they have worked a lot of time in our academies (during off-season), having faced 1000s of balls and I'm happy with the way they're progressing.

Yes, there was that Dhruv Jurel magic, but the Royals never really looked out of the contest. There could be questions about Ashwin's promotion and the non-boundary overs from 8-11, and of course the struggles of Padikkal. Despite all of that, they threatened to steal the game thanks to a 22 year-old superstar Dhruv Jurel. The impact player not only proved his worth in his first-ever outing of the IPL, but displayed his range and fierce attitude during his 15-ball 32. All said and done, Nathan Ellis deserves a huge chunk of credit for Punjab's victory. He bowled at crucial stages of the game and picked up important wickets to draw the game in his side's favour. On a day which saw the bowlers travel frequently, Ellis picked up 4 and just conceded 30 off his 4 overs. Bonzer!! Post-match reactions imminent, stick around...",

There could be questions about Ashwin's promotion and the non-boundary overs from 8-11, and of course the struggles of Padikkal.

He did get better as his innings progressed, Rajapaksa was unfortunate to be forced to retire hurt, Jitesh played a nice little cameo, but PBKS didn't get the finish they'd have wanted.
