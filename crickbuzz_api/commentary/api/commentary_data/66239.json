Stoinis kept us in the game and I knew this was a nice wicket. We could chase even over 50 in the last four, it was about cashing in. The second ball I came in and smashed a six. It isn't about getting a look in, if it is in my slot then I will smash it for six. Over the past couple of years, I've put a lot of pressure on myself to finish games. Today also I wanted to finish the game, but got out in the end. I hope this is the season for me, in a good space and state of mind.

We had to go hard and the ball swung early, and they got 2-3 wickets to put the pressure on us. The only reason we got two points today is for the way the lower order batted. Not ideal for me, I want to score more runs and get the strike rate up as well. We've played on two tough Lucknow wickets, and today we lost 3 wickets so I went slower. I wanted to stay till the end and play with Nicky. Batting 5 ,6, 7 is the toughest positions to play and that's where games are won and lost. We know about the power in Marcus and Nicky, and Ayush has come along as well. He's played 2-3 knocks last year, and he's continued to perform well for us.",

We are a young franchise. We hadn't won a game away from home this season yet, it's important. We're all getting on really well. That's important to get some momentum early. It's fun to hit the middle of the bat and contribute for the team. We did (when asked if his team believed that it was an achievable target), we actually bowled well in the powerplay, it was some beautiful batting from Virat and Faf. Some of those shots, you don't see everyday. We bowled okay there and our spinners bowled beautifully. History suggests that 200 is pretty much par.

This game had everything, a vintage Virat Kohli knock in the powerplay, a 115m six from Faf, Glenn Maxwell's return to form. And that's just the first innings... In the chase, LSG lost Mayers for a duck, as Siraj cleaned him up with a superb ball in the first over. Deepak Hooda and Krunal Pandya also fell cheaply, as debutant Wayne Parnell was making merry. LSG were struggling at the end of the powerplay, and it needed some big boy power from Marcus Stoinis to get them back in the contest. The big Aussie took on Harshal Patel and Karn Sharma, scoring big sixes down the ground as he notched his first fifty of the season. Still, the game was in the balance. Stoinis got out, and then KL Rahul departed as well. But out walked 16 crore man Nicholas Pooran and showed the world why so many teams tend to break the bank for him! He smoked seven sixes and four fours in his innings, hitting virtually anything on his pads to get the fastest fifty of this season (15 balls). Pooran couldn't stay the course, but Ayush Badoni filled in and scored a big shots. He'd have pretty much surely won the game with a ramped six over fine leg in the penultimate over, but he dragged his bat back onto the stumps and was hit-wicket. The hosts kept the fight on, getting two of their tailenders out cheaply. B1$ But instead it was a last ball finish where DK fumbled and LSG scampered for the bye....

Not ideal for me, I want to score more runs and get the strike rate up as well. We've played on two tough Lucknow wickets, and today we lost 3 wickets so I went slower. I wanted to stay till the end and play with Nicky. Batting 5 ,6, 7 is the toughest positions to play and that's where games are won and lost.

This game had everything, a vintage Virat Kohli knock in the powerplay, a 115m six from Faf, Glenn Maxwell's return to form. And that's just the first innings... In the chase, LSG lost Mayers for a duck, as Siraj cleaned him up with a superb ball in the first over. Deepak Hooda and Krunal Pandya also fell cheaply, as debutant Wayne Parnell was making merry. LSG were struggling at the end of the powerplay, and it needed some big boy power from Marcus Stoinis to get them back in the contest. The big Aussie took on Harshal Patel and Karn Sharma, scoring big sixes down the ground as he notched his first fifty of the season. Still, the game was in the balance. Stoinis got out, and then KL Rahul departed as well. But out walked 16 crore man Nicholas Pooran and showed the world why so many teams tend to break the bank for him! He smoked seven sixes and four fours in his innings, hitting virtually anything on his pads to get the fastest fifty of this season (15 balls). Pooran couldn't stay the course, but Ayush Badoni filled in and scored a big shots. He'd have pretty much surely won the game with a ramped six over fine leg in the penultimate over, but he dragged his bat back onto the stumps and was hit-wicket. The hosts kept the fight on, getting two of their tailenders out cheaply. B1$ But instead it was a last ball finish where DK fumbled and LSG scampered for the bye.... Ah IPL, the gift that keeps on giving!",

The guys have been really good, everyone has stepped up to this level. The bowlers have also stepped up even though we know IPL is a difficult tournament for bowlers. (On Mark Wood) He\u2019s rapid, it is exciting for him as well and it is always nice to have an X-factor in your team. He gets you wickets at crucial times.
