Who would have predicted a third off the last ball when just before that Raza was potentially asking if he can be retired off so that a better runner could come in for the last ball [later Raza clarified post-match he was not sure what the talk was about]. If you were a bookie, you would have predicted anything but a third off that delivery. But PBKS get home in a thriller and it is Raza who has hit the winning runs. Earlier on, PBKS knew that the powerplay was the phase when they had to go harder as the wicket was bound to get slower. Dhawan and Prabhsimran got off to a quick start before the former fell. Dhoni soon brought on his spinners and that began the middle phase when the runs did not come fluently and the wickets came. The two Englishmen - Livingstone and Curran joined hands and immediately after the 2nd timeout, Deshpande and Jadeja went for 41 in 2 overs which turned the game. CSK though came back with crucial wickets even as Jitesh again looked set to take his side home but a close call went CSK's way in the penultimate over when the sub Rasheed's catch was deemed OK by the third ump. Raza came out and struck a boundary before he finished it off in the final over against Pathirana who bowled really well but ended up on the losing side. Not easy to chase 200 against CSK at home but PBKS have just done that which will boost their confidence so much. Stay tuned for the presentations...",

Who would have predicted a third off the last ball when just before that Raza was potentially asking if he can be retired off so that a better runner could come in for the last ball [later Raza clarified post-match he was not sure what the talk was about]. If you were a bookie, you would have predicted anything but a third off that delivery. But PBKS get home in a thriller and it is Raza who has hit the winning runs. Earlier on, PBKS knew that the powerplay was the phase when they had to go harder as the wicket was bound to get slower. Dhawan and Prabhsimran got off to a quick start before the former fell. Dhoni soon brought on his spinners and that began the middle phase when the runs did not come fluently and the wickets came. The two Englishmen - Livingstone and Curran joined hands and immediately after the 2nd timeout, Deshpande and Jadeja went for 41 in 2 overs which turned the game. CSK though came back with crucial wickets even as Jitesh again looked set to take his side home but a close call went CSK's way in the penultimate over when the sub Rasheed's catch was deemed OK by the third ump. Raza came out and struck a boundary before he finished it off in the final over against Pathirana who bowled really well but ended up on the losing side. Not easy to chase 200 against CSK at home but PBKS have just done that which will boost their confidence so much. Stay tuned for the presentations...",

Gaikwad and Dube also chipped in during different phases, helping CSK post a formidable total on a dry pitch. The pacers did a decent job for PBKS towards the end, but they weren't quite on the money in the powerplay.

    "commText": "B0$ by B1$ \\n \\nPunjab Kings are in a tricky territory. They did begin their campaign in style by winning their opening two games but since then, they have managed only two wins out of six. Given how the race for a top-four finish is getting trickier with each passing day, they cannot afford to keep slipping. The last thing they would have wanted in such a scenario is a trip to Chennai and take the field less than 48 hours from their previous encounter that ended in a defeat. Such is the nature of the schedule that PBKS will get into this game without a practice session at a venue where not many visiting teams end up on the winning side. \\n \\nWhile the scores have been better than anticipated initially at Chepauk so far this season, the last game against Sunrisers Hyderabad had enough indications of spin slowly making headlines again. CSK's spin trio of Maheesh Theekshana, Moeen Ali and Ravindra Jadeja will prove to be quite a handful against a free-flowing batting lineup that predominantly thrives on good batting surfaces. Their skipper Shikhar Dhawan has made a timely return to the XI to bolster that batting lineup but the young Indian trio of Prabhsimran Singh, Atharva Taide and Jitesh Sharma won't have it easy given it's a day game which takes the dew factor out of the equation. \\n \\nEven on the bowling front, PBKS will have to rely on their spin attack to keep them in the game. Rahul Chahar hasn't picked a wicket in his last five games and has only two scalps to his name overall in the tournament so far. Conditions will allow him to break the rut but can he make it count? PBKS will also hope that Sikandar Raza the bowler comes to the party finally. \\n \\nFrom CSK's perspective, they will be looking at this game to quickly return to winning ways after losing to Rajasthan Royals for the second time this season. That batting order has the ability to push the total beyond the par score and the bowling unit is starting to deliver despite the setbacks they have suffered due to injuries. Plenty of players had an off colour day at Jaipur but the overall form guide and the conditions make CSK absolute favourites on Sunday. \\n \\nB2$ April 30 at 15:30 IST \\n \\nB3$ MA Chidambaram Stadium, Chennai \\n \\nB4$ This will be the first day game of the season in Chennai and as a result, both captains won't have to worry about dew. CSK generally prefer chasing but batting first is definitely not a bad idea if the teams are presented with a slowish track. The game could be interrupted by a bit of rain at noon but the forecast isn't threatening enough. \\n \\nB5$ \\n \\nB6$ \\n \\nCSK are expected to stick with the same side. Ben Stokes and Deepak Chahar are still not ready. \\n \\nB7$ Devon Conway, Ruturaj Gaikwad, Ajinkya Rahane, Moeen Ali, Shivam Dube, Ravindra Jadeja, MS Dhoni (C&WK), Tushar Deshpande, Matheesha Pathirana, Maheesh Theekshana, Akash Singh \\n \\nB8$ Ambati Rayudu might not have had a huge say so far as an impact player but his presence could prove to be crucial against Rahul Chahar given his numbers against the leggie, who otherwise has pretty good record against most of the CSK batters. \\n \\nB9$ \\n \\nSikandar Raza is expected to hold onto his spot with his bowling expected to come in handy. Harpreet Brar wasn't in the XI last time but is expected to return on Sunday. \\n \\nB7$ Shikhar Dhawan, Atharva Taide, Liam Livingstone, Sikandar Raza, Jitesh Sharma (WK), Sam Curran, Shahrukh Khan, Harpreet Brar, Kagiso Rabada, Rahul Chahar, Arshdeep Singh \\n \\nB8$ If the conditions are indeed slow, Dhawan is PBKS' best bet to tackle Jadeja given his excellent record against the left-arm spinner. Dhawan's SR against Jadeja is over 140 and he has been dismissed by the allrounder only once in the IPL in the last decade. \\n \\nB12$ \\n \\n- Rahul Chahar has a good record at Chepauk, picking 11 wickets in 7 games so far at an excellent ER of 6.14 \\n \\n- Shikhar Dhawan has over 6000 runs in the IPL. 1029 of those have come against CSK \\n \\nB13$ \\n \\n\"Home games are massively important. We saw what happened in the last game, Rajasthan knew exactly how to play in their conditions. It takes a while for the opposition to adjust. I don't think a team has got a good record at home as CSK has and that's one of the advantages. We got a team that understands our conditions.\" - Eric Simmons, CSK Bowling Consultant",
