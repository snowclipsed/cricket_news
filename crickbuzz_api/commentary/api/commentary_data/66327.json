    "commText": "Another high octane clash has ended. MI have clinched another win by scaling down another highish total. But the impact player rule has ensured that big scores have been scored quite regularly this season. But MI seem to be clicking as a unit and that should be great news for their fans. Their skipper is misfiring but the others seem to be hitting the right targets with the bat. The bowlers can do better but who cares when they have such a prolific batting line up to boast of. Punjab have had hits and misses this season. This one goes into the miss category. A big miss though as they had amassed 214 on the board. In mid table muddle, they had a chance to get away but remain on 10 points. The earlier game in the day has forced the experts already to bring out the imaginary calculators as both CSK and LSG had to share points. The IPL is just about to getting to that point where every win or loss will be a defining blow. We will be there to detail it out to you. But for now, we will breeze away. Our team of B0$ will bow out for the day!",

I think it doesn't matter much when you are chasing 215 (whether the fielder is there or not in the areas you try and hit big shots). Last game we did well and finished in the last over.

Before the start of the season, we had a chat as to how we wanted to play our cricket. Not to think of the results too much. We want to go out there and just express ourselves. You will lose games here and there. We want to stick to this template. Kishan is powerful. He practises those kind of shots. He has been working really hard for the last couple of weeks. I wouldn't say a worrying factor. But we need to think how to shut down overs. Three to four games we have conceded more than 200. When the pressure is on, you need to execute what is best for you.",

Punjab have had hits and misses this season. This one goes into the miss category. A big miss though as they had amassed 214 on the board. In mid table muddle, they had a chance to get away but remain on 10 points. The earlier game in the day has forced the experts already to bring out the imaginary calculators as both CSK and LSG had to share points. The IPL is just about to getting to that point where every win or loss will be a defining blow. We will be there to detail it out to you. But for now, we will breeze away.

    "commText": "B0$ \\n  \\nOn the back of morale boosting 200+ successful chases in IPL's 999th and 1000th match respectively, Punjab Kings and Mumbai Indians would aim to take down another playoffs' contender in their reverse clash at Mohali on Wednesday (May 3), weather permitting. \\n \\nPBKS are flying high after having gunned down a 201-target against CSK at Chepauk off the last ball, while Mumbai stunned Rajasthan Royals by chasing down an improbable 213 - with 32 required off the final 12 deliveries - courtesy Tim David's brutal death-overs hitting that included a hat-trick of last over sixes. As such, IPL 2023 has been set alight with a highly volatile points table. Five teams, starting right from second-placed RR, are tied on 10 points each with an identical five wins in nine outings and separated only on NRR. Punjab Kings are the last of that lot. Their opponents, Mumbai Indians are just below them, with eight points at no. 7 but also have the cushion of an additional game in hand. As the race for playoffs intensifies, both teams can ill afford to take their foot off the pedal. \\n \\nOver the years, Punjab have more often than not found itself at the receiving end of close encounters that eventually costs them a playoffs spot. However, the Shikhar Dhawan-led side is finally finding ways to reverse the trend this year to collect crucial points. That said, their campaign has still lacked consistency - the results getting partly affected due to unavailability of core personnel at various points. They've won three out of their last five now, but those victories have been punctuated by defeats. Add to it a worrisome home record - they've won just one of the four in Mohali thus far - where they'd want to sign off with a W before shifting base to Dharamsala next. \\n \\nMuch like PBKS, Mumbai would also be pleased with their batting depth coming to the fore of late to win them games. The perennial slow starters of IPL claimed a thrilling win at home to snap their two-match losing streak without having to sub in their impact player in a 200+ chase, which is a definite plus. But their bowling has been a real concern. They've especially tinkered with their pace-bowling attack often and, besides leggie Piyush Chawla's tally of 13, don't have a lot to write home about. \\n \\nGiven how their campaigns have ebbed and flowed, neither of the two teams go into the contest as real favourites. But, in an uncharacteristically cold Mohali, the conditions could give Punjab's in-form pace duo of Arshdeep Singh and Kagiso Rabada an ever so slight advantage. \\n \\nB1$ Wednesday, May 3 at 7:30 PM IST \\n \\nB2$ Punjab Cricket Association IS Bindra Stadium, Mohali \\n \\nB3$ The sun hasn't been out much the whole of this week and there's a real nip in the air from consistent overnight showers. There's also some rain forecast in the lead-up to the match tomorrow. Teams batting first have won three out of the four encounters in Mohali this season, with the hosts being successful in just one game. \\n \\nB4$ Punjab vs Mumbai has been a neck-and-neck battle in IPL. The teams have a 15-all record in their 30 encounters thus far, and an even 5-all since 2018. \\n \\nB5$ \\n \\nB6$ \\n \\nGiven their packed travel and match schedule last few days, the hosts had an optional training session on the eve of the match. \\n \\nB7$ PBKS inexplicably left Rabada out of their game against RCB despite the South African's stellar record against their key batters, and can ill afford a similar miss again. Rabada has dismissed Rohit Sharma four times and Suryakumar Yadav thrice in IPL, making it a subplot worth keeping an eye on. \\n \\nB8$ Shikhar Dhawan (c), Prabhsimran Singh, Atharva Taide, Liam Livingstone, Sikandar Raza, Sam Curran, Jitesh Sharma (wk), Shahrukh Khan, Kagiso Rabada, Rahul Chahar, Arshdeep Singh \\n \\nB9$ \\n \\nThe visitors might be tempted to give local hero Ramandeep Singh a go here, even if just as an impact sub. \\n \\nB7$ In an innings of 182/6 against the hosts in 2019, Jofra Archer finished with impressive figures of 3-15 from his four overs at a ground that has generally churned batter-friendly conditions. He would be expected to shoulder MI's otherwise troubled pace department again, especially with overcast conditions likely to come to his aid. \\n \\nB8$ Rohit Sharma (C), Ishan Kishan (wk), Cameron Green, Suryakumar Yadav, Tilak Varma, Tim David, Jofra Archer, Arjun Tendulkar, Piyush Chawla, Kumar Kartikeya, Riley Meredith \\n \\nB12$ \\n \\n- Suryakumar Yadav is 6 sixes away from completing 100 in IPL. \\n \\n- Shikhar Dhawan is one away from completing a half-century of 50s in IPL, and three catches away from a 100 in the competition. \\n \\n- Piyush Chawla needs 3 scalps to break into the top-three of IPL's all-time highest wicket-takers. \\n \\n- Jofra Archer is two away from recording 50 IPL wickets. \\n \\nB13$ \\n \\n\"No, not at all. He's getting us starts and he's in good touch. Definitely, a big, big hundred is incoming. Rohit Sharma's name itself is quite enough. Having such a player in your batting line-up obviously makes a difference, and has an impact on the opposition as well. They [oppositions] are literally scared of him, and we can see that on the field.\" - B14$ on whether Rohit Sharma's form is a concern for MI",
