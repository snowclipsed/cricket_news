There was a resurrecting job done by Venkatesh Iyer, who was drafted in as an Impact player and Nitish Rana but the latter fell to Raza and Rinku Singh fell early. At that stage, DreRuss joined Iyer and the duo took the attack to PBKS. But after an expensive over, Sam Curran got the big wicket of Russell and when the rain started appearing, KKR were behind on DLS. Russell's wicket further set them back and despite a couple of sixes, they were behind by 7 on DLS par when play was stopped. Shikhar Dhawan cleverly rotated his spinners to rush through the overs perhaps sensing rain was in the air and the ploy worked. Stick around for the presentations..",

There was a resurrecting job done by Venkatesh Iyer, who was drafted in as an Impact player and Nitish Rana but the latter fell to Raza and Rinku Singh fell early. At that stage, DreRuss joined Iyer and the duo took the attack to PBKS. But after an expensive over, Sam Curran got the big wicket of Russell and when the rain started appearing, KKR were behind on DLS. Russell's wicket further set them back and despite a couple of sixes, they were behind by 7 on DLS par when play was stopped. Shikhar Dhawan cleverly rotated his spinners to rush through the overs perhaps sensing rain was in the air and the ploy worked. Stick around for the presentations..",

So, I try to be as relaxed as possible. In the back of my mind, I know that we've been here for years now and he is more senior than me. I look to make sure to get the job done and do my best all the time. (On their roles) Yeah, we do talk about it but not that much. I know that my part is to finish games, to get the team to a good total whenever batting first. He knows his job is to bowl four overs, get as many wickets as possible and keep bowling tight. My job in the field is to field in the hotspots. So, at the end of the day, we discuss stuff but not too much. He knows his role, I know my role. (On their targets) I won't say it, but I do have my goals when I come to tournaments. I'd like to raise the bar every year.

It will be a real test for him but he has some exciting players at his disposal. They are a side who rely on all-rounders and they certainly bat deep. Shardul Thakur and Lockie Ferguson were traded in by them pre-season and that definitely adds sharpness to their bowling. In the last season, both Punjab and Kolkata had middling returns and they will be eager to come to the fore with a solid opening game. Will Punjab Kings rule the roost at their home ground? Or will KKR fire on all cylinders today? The toss and team lineups will be out in a while.",

Although they haven\u2019t won the IPL till now, they do have a lot of firepower in their side. They bought Sam Curran with a record-breaking bid at the auction and the young man will be certainly striving to impress.
