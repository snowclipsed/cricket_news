The spirit and the atmosphere changed after getting wickets, that's a very great feeling. A win like this can boost your confidence. I think the way the wicket was playing, we could have got 10 runs more. There was uncertainty. They bowled well and made our life difficult. Batters couldn't get rhythm because of the wicket. During the strategic timeout we spoke about the set batter going for it towards the end. We were always chasing them, and never in it. When they needed 30 runs in 30 balls, I thought they were ahead. But when they required 27 in 4 overs, I thought they were under pressure. That's where I thought we could be in the game. The way every bowler contributed, as a captain I couldn't have asked for. The amount of cricket he (Mohit Sharma) has played, I don't have to interfere. He made my life easy, he backed his plans and executed it. Shami and Mohit were tremendous, special mention to Jayant who was playing after a long time. Noor has some talent as well.",

Lucknow Super Giants were absolutely cantering along towards the target at the end of 15 overs, but the Gujarat Titans pulled things back in fine style to pull off a heist. KL Rahul notched up a quick fifty, but he looked completely out of place once he got there. Losing wickets from the other end didn't help LSG's cause either as the Titans stole the show when it mattered the most. Right from Noor Ahmad's spell to Shami's 19th over, and then Mohit Sharma bowling an exceptional final over. Quite a bowling effort that! But there have been such finishes in IPL before, and hopefully we'll have them in future as well. Wasn't an easy to pitch to bat on, and barring a couple of batters, none of them were able to get going on it. Stay around for the presentations..",

I think the way the wicket was playing, we could have got 10 runs more. There was uncertainty. They bowled well and made our life difficult. Batters couldn't get rhythm because of the wicket. During the strategic timeout we spoke about the set batter going for it towards the end. We were always chasing them, and never in it. When they needed 30 runs in 30 balls, I thought they were ahead. But when they required 27 in 4 overs, I thought they were under pressure. That's where I thought we could be in the game. The way every bowler contributed, as a captain I couldn't have asked for. The amount of cricket he (Mohit Sharma) has played, I don't have to interfere. He made my life easy, he backed his plans and executed it.

KL Rahul notched up a quick fifty, but he looked completely out of place once he got there. Losing wickets from the other end didn't help LSG's cause either as the Titans stole the show when it mattered the most. Right from Noor Ahmad's spell to Shami's 19th over, and then Mohit Sharma bowling an exceptional final over. Quite a bowling effort that!

Krunal, Mishra, Naveen-ul-Haq and Stoinis used the variations well to strangulate the Titans.

    "commText": "B0$ by  B1$ \\n \\nAnchors may no longer be cool in T20s but when you have a couple of designated ones in KL Rahul and Shubman Gill going up against each other, the conditions better be relevant for the face-off. And Lucknow has the stage set for it. Saturday's afternoon game between the sides will be played on a used black-soil pitch, so those hoping to keep a tally of the sixes may want to look somewhere else. \\n \\nGujarat Titans wouldn't mind such conditions at this point in their campaign. They haven't been able to defend totals very well this season - losing two in two - and have been consistently beaten by teams out-muscling them with the big hits. This pitch and near-identical ground dimensions on both sides of the square in Lucknow could instead play to one of their strengths of late, i.e. keeping the dot-ball percentage to a minimum. The defending champions are also coming back from a five-day break, giving them the opportunity for a new take at what's been an inconsistent campaign at best. And what better team to start against than LSG, whom they beat last year to become the first team to make it to the Play-offs. \\n \\nFor Lucknow Super Giants, it's an opportunity to build on their fantastic win in Jaipur. On a slow pitch at the Sawai Mansingh Stadium, Kyle Mayers adjusted well to the task at hand and scored his half-century at an uncharacteristic strike-rate of 120. It was also the game where the season came alive for Avesh Khan, and his breakthrough performance couldn't have come at a better time for LSG, who play three of their next four games at home. They wouldn't mind kicking it off with their first ever victory over GT, a side they couldn't beat in two attempts last year. \\n \\nB2$ LSG vs GT, Match 30, IPL 2023 at 3:30 PM local \\n \\nB3$ Bharat Ratna Shri Atal Bihari Vajpayee Ekana Cricket Stadium, Lucknow \\n \\nB4$ A game of attrition. The match is being played on pitch #6 on the square and will bring with it a new set of dynamics. The first three IPL games here have witnessed 193 playing 143, 121 playing 127 and 159 playing 161, so what scores awaits us in this game is anybody's guess. But what's known is that the square is very dry and the curators are trying their best to make do this season before looking at long-term solutions. \\n \\nFortunately for the players, the temperatures have come down lately in Lucknow but that's not to suggest that an afternoon game wouldn't test the players. \\n \\nB5$ \\n \\nB6$ \\n \\nQuinton de Kock batted beside KL Rahul during practice but after Mayers' fifty in the last game, it looks unlikely that he will get a crack. Mark Wood didn't play the last game in Jaipur and he's unlikely to play the afternoon game, especially with Naveen-ul-Haq starting well in his absence. The Afghanistan pacer looked unflappable bowling to the likes of Jos Buttler, Shimron Hetmyer and Yashasvi Jaiswal on his IPL debut and will be keen to emulate the same at home. \\n \\nB7$ Kyle Mayers strikes at under 89 against left-arm pacers and will have to come out trumps against the challenge of Joshua Little. \\n \\nB8$ KL Rahul(c), Kyle Mayers, Deepak Hooda, Marcus Stoinis, Krunal Pandya, Nicholas Pooran(w), Ayush Badoni, Naveen-ul-Haq, Avesh Khan, Yudhvir Singh Charak, Ravi Bishnoi \\n \\nB9$ \\n \\nVijay Shankar has been in and out with back spasms and even missed the last game. If he's fit, he should slot back right in for Abhinav Manohar. \\n \\nB7$ Expect Rashid Khan to bowl in the PowerPlay to KL Rahul, whom he has dismissed thrice already. The LSG opener averages 6 and strikes at 60 against the legspinner. \\n \\nB8$ Wriddhiman Saha(w), Shubman Gill, Sai Sudharsan, Hardik Pandya (c), Vijay Shankar/Abhinav Manohar, David Miller, Rahul Tewatia, Rashid Khan, Alzarri Joseph, Mohammed Shami, Mohit Sharma/Noor Ahmad (Impact Player) \\n \\nDid you know? \\n \\n- In their last encounter against GT, LSG were bowled out for 82 inside 14 overs.- KL Rahul vs Mohammed Shami in IPL: 18 balls, 13 runs, 2 dismissals- Avesh Khan has enjoyed success against Shubman Gill and Hardik Pandya, getting both the batters out twice. \\n \\nB12$ \\n \\n\"I am focused on IPL since that's what's going on at the moment. Everybody wants to play for India but it's always better to stay in the present, focus on the tournament and the game at hand. Even in the IPL, I don't plan for the next game.\" B13$ \\n \\n\"If you look at IPL, you don't want eleven guys to perform at the same time. He's one of our big match players, he's our senior batter and he's going to come good. Seven-eight games to go and these guys with experience of playing in the IPL will catch up.\" B14$",
