When the second six was struck, we started believing more because Yash Dayal wasn't executing that well. As a captain, it's important to have the belief. But this is a 1 in a 100 chance for something like this to happen. We were good with the ball except the last two overs. Same thing with the bat - that over from Rashid put us on the back foot. Credit goes to Rinku Singh. The two points we have from this game are thanks to him. People asked me why Rinku Singh doesn't get a bigger role, and always plays a small role. I want to say to those reporters if this is the second role, imagine what he can do with the first role. Last match he played a different role, and he did it well. To be honest, if I was batting and needed 30 off one over, the thought of having the belief would be there, but in your heart you know what you're capable of. I don't have words for him.",

We will learn from it, more importantly a good game of cricket and the fans would have loved it. It was more about what he is most comfortable with, to trust his plans [on Yash Dayal's plans]. Rinku played unbelievable shots and credit goes to him for the way he played and for the way he finished. Keep it simple, hit the right area consistently and that's what T20 is all about. As a bowler I'm always trying to hit the right area. We got what we wanted. We wanted 190 and we got 200. As a bowling unit we got enough to defend, but sometimes in T20 even 250 does not look good. Take positives from this, it's still early in the competition and learn from it. Definitely not [on if this defeat will hurt morale]. Chin up and keep smiling and we come back stronger and stronger. It's good and something new is happening in T20, it makes you mature and I feel it's very good for the game of cricket [on the new rules].

But this is a 1 in a 100 chance for something like this to happen. We were good with the ball except the last two overs. Same thing with the bat - that over from Rashid put us on the back foot. Credit goes to Rinku Singh. The two points we have from this game are thanks to him. People asked me why Rinku Singh doesn't get a bigger role, and always plays a small role. I want to say to those reporters if this is the second role, imagine what he can do with the first role. Last match he played a different role, and he did it well.

After Saha went for 17, the in-form Sai Sudharsan and Shubman Gill strung a partnership which was based on the latter's use of the feet against the spinners and the former's quick running. Gill holed out and after Manohar's cameo was ended by a fine googly, it was the turn of the two TN statemates to make an impact. Sudharsan reached his 2nd fifty in 2 matches and then it was the Shankar show. Especially the last two overs. Rana probably erred by not giving Varun his full quota and trusting Shardul over Umesh for the final over. But take nothing away from GT's batting and running which was superb throughout.

However, they stood tall in their next game against RCB at Eden Gardens and stormed to a massive victory. The fact that Shardul Thakul pulled them out with the bat from a precarious situation shows the depth they possess. Consistency is what has eluded them in the past as well and that\u2019s a big area to work upon. Can the Knights stop the march of the Titans? Or will the Titans make it a hat-trick of victories? Stick around as toss and team lineups are around the corner..",

After that, GT travelled to Delhi and registered a clinical victory against the hosts  another prime example that they have all their bases covered.

    "commText": "B0$ \\n \\nThey have the arsenal to strike in the PowerPlay, the personnel to choke and hustle through the middle-overs and a batting line-up that has 10 successful chases out of 11. On Sunday afternoon, as Hardik Pandya and Co begin the next lap through their crazy, HAHA (Home-Away) fixture list, they will look to replicate what they did last year during their title-winning run: start the season with three straight wins. With the prodigious Sai Sudarshan seamlessly filling in the Kane Williamson void, the champions look as formidable as ever as they look to make another deep run in this tournament. \\n \\nOn the other hand, the Knight Riders have been in troubleshooting mode, exacerbated by the season-ending injury to regular captain Shreyas Iyer and the withdrawal of Shakib Al Hasan. But amid the chaos came a backs-to-the-wall performance against the Royal Challengers Bangalore two nights ago, one in which Shardul Thakur engineered a comeback with a blistering half-century before passing on the baton to Sunil Narine and Varun Chakravarthy to get the team on the board. \\n \\nThere are still problems in the team, most notably at the top of the order, where KKR have gone through eight different opening combinations in the last 16 games. Several batters are in search of confidence and runs but coach Chandrakant Pandit will know that at 89/5 in the last game, things could have been so much worse. And so onwards to Ahmedabad for them and hopefully upwards too. \\n \\nB1$Gujarat Titans vs Kolkata Knight Riders, IPL 2023, April 9, 15:30 IST \\n \\nB2$Narendra Modi Stadium, Ahmedabad \\n \\nB3$The mercury is expected to hit 40 degree Celsius this week in Ahmedabad and an afternoon game will test the sides. Teams will stick to the trusted doctrine of chasing but there will be respite for the batting team, most specifically from the harsh afternoon sun. \\n \\nB4$GT 1-0 KKR. The Titans prevailed in the only game they played against KKR last season, surviving an all-round effort from Andre Russell to sneak home in the final over at the DY Patil Stadium. \\n \\nB5$ \\n \\nB6$ \\n \\nB7$ \\n \\nVenkatesh Iyer was favoured ahead of Gill for retention by KKR but since then the journey for the two players have gone in opposite directions and not in the way KKR would have wanted it to pan out. \\n \\nNow, KKR have a top-order problem and in Mohammed Shami, the Titans have one of the best PowerPlay strike bowlers in the league to exploit it. In fact, since 2020, Shami's tally of 25 wickets in the first-six overs is second only to that of Trent Boult (33). \\n \\nB8$Shubman Gill, Wriddhiman Saha (wk), Sai Sudarshan, Hardik Pandya (c), David Miller, Rahul Tewatia, Rashid Khan, Alzarri Joseph, Mohammed Shami, Joshua Little, Yash Dayal \\n \\nB9$ \\n \\nMandeep Singh has had scores of 2 and 0 in the two games this season and while another opportunity could be granted, KKR have in their ranks have N Jagadeesan who is coming off a good domestic season. \\n \\nB7$ \\n \\nVarun Chakravarthy is among the few bowlers in the KKR setup to have managed to keep Hardik Pandya quiet (21 runs off 21 balls) in the IPL and given his good start to the season, is a likely match-up option when the Titans skipper walks out to bat. \\n \\nB8$Venkatesh Iyer, Rahmanullah Gurbaz (wk), Mandeep Singh/N Jagadeesan, Nitish Rana (c), Rinku Singh, Andre Russell, Shardul Thakur, Sunil Narine, Tim Southee, Umesh Yadav, Varun Chakravarthy \\n \\nB12$ \\n \\n- Hardik Pandya has scored 366 runs at an average of 61 and SR of 173.46 against KKR. This includes his highest score (91) in the IPL \\n \\n- Sunil Narine (155) and Rashid Khan (117) are the two most successful overseas spinners in IPL and the only ones with 100+ wickets. \\n \\nB13$ \\n \\n\"KKR are a strong team with some really good mystery bowlers.
