(On David being next Pollard) Big shoes to fill, Polly for so many years won us so many championships. But Tim has so much ability and power. In the back end, having that power keeps the bowler thinking. (On team changes) It is difficult as a captain, but unfortunately you have to play the conditions and the opposition. We want to be flexible as a team and guys need to be ready for it. Jofra has had a massive injury and didn't play for a long, long time. Bowlers need practice and rhythm, and we saw good pace from him today. SKY obviously we knew a knock like today was round the corner. (On Jaiswal) I watched him last year, this year he has taken his game to a new level. I asked him where all that power is coming from, he says he is spending time at the gym, he's timing them really well. Good for him, good for Indian cricket and good for RR as well.",

In the back end, having that power keeps the bowler thinking. (On team changes) It is difficult as a captain, but unfortunately you have to play the conditions and the opposition. We want to be flexible as a team and guys need to be ready for it. Jofra has had a massive injury and didn't play for a long, long time. Bowlers need practice and rhythm, and we saw good pace from him today. SKY obviously we knew a knock like today was round the corner. (On Jaiswal) I watched him last year, this year he has taken his game to a new level. I asked him where all that power is coming from, he says he is spending time at the gym, he's timing them really well. Good for him, good for Indian cricket and good for RR as well.",

A spectacular chase by the home side, they needed this win and Suryakumar, Cam Green, Tilak Varma and then Tim David were determined to get them there!! MI lost the wicket of Rohit early, and Kishan threatened in the powerplay but fell to his kryptonite of off spin. MI looked forlorn in the first 10 overs of the innings, as they allowed Ashwin to bowl out a meagre spell. However, the turning point came when Suryakumar Yadav took on impact player Kuldeep Sen and smoked 20 off the over. Today was the day the top-ranked T20I batter really came to the party, as he entertained the crowd with some of his trademark strokes. He deserved to end things, and would have been there too but for a surreal catch from Sandeep Sharma running back from short fine. However, nothing was to stop MI today as Tim David came out and played an unreal cameo - 45 off 14 balls, with five sixes. A crucial win for MI... but spare a thought for Yashasvi Jaiswal who played the innings of this IPL, scored his maiden IPL ton but ended on the wrong side of the result.",

The youngsters like Yashasvi Jaiswal and Dhruv Jurel are making the most of the opportunity and ensuring there's not much pressure on the senior batters. There's a good mix in the bowling as well and they have gone horses for courses - whenever the surface seems a bit slow, Adam Zampa has replaced Trent Boult and done a superb job. The only area of concern is their skipper's form. Sanju Samson is once again being inconsistent and if he can contribute in every game then it would be difficult to stop this RR team.",

This season, however, the two teams are at opposite ends of the points table; Rajasthan Royals sit in third place while Mumbai Indians are languishing at 9th.

    "commText": "B0$ by B1$ \\n \\nAs the IPL reaches a mega milestone of 1000th game on Sunday, there's a lot similar to when it all commenced, in 2008. Rajasthan Royals were not heavyweights, and yet, a wonder side that was unstoppable in that season. Champions too. \\n \\nFifteen years on, they look unstoppable again - five wins from eight games and second in the points table - the interregnum period of 14 years seeing only occasional sparks, but never as imperious as they were then in 2008 and now in 2023. Maybe, as they say about the world order, the more the league changes, the more it gets to the same position. \\n \\nIt is not often a visiting side to the Wankhede can be termed as favourites against the hosts - the mighty Mumbai Indians - but that is the reality of the season. The Royals, with firepower at the top of the batting order in the form of Yashasvi Jaiswal, Jos Buttler, followed by Sanju Samson, Devdutt Padikkal, Shimron Hetmeyer, and their season's find, Dhruv Jurel, have become too hot for many a bowling attack. No wonder they are second among the teams who scored most (1476) runs in the season so far, behind CSK (1495). \\n \\nIt's a batting order that is in sizzling form and one that can test the best of attacks in the league. Their bowling is equally effective, with spin twins R Ashiwin and Yuzvendra Chahal, assisted by the swing and seam of Trent Boult upfront. It looks like a complete side with Samson as the skipper. \\n \\n\"Those guys are just confident. They are realistic, they go out and play their natural game. It has been great to come here early and I have seen the hard work that has gone in prior to the IPL start. They played with freedom and played some great innings. Yashasvi is an incredible find and the one to watch out for India as well - he has played some great knocks already,\" Boult, who will be back in the mix on Saturday after missing the franchise's previous game, said. \\n \\nThe Mumbai Indians used to be a complete side but in the past. The absence of Jasprit Bumrah and uncertainty over the availability of Jofra Archer has made it a weak-kneed bowling attack that got miserably exposed this season often, particularly in the last game in Ahmedabad, where they were hammered for over 200 runs in their last two games. \\n \\nMore than the runs conceded, the MI attack looking brittle in terms of personnel, having to depend on a veteran like Piyush Chawla for breakthrough and penetration has left them missing Bumrah like never before. Additionally, the batting lost its mojo suddenly, the problem starting from the very top. Rohit Sharma, the irrepressible skipper, is awfully out of form and it is not helping the Mumbai cause. So much so that Sunil Gavaskar has had to suggest that the MI skipper can do well by taking a break. \\n \\n\"I would like to see some change in the batting order. Honestly, I would also say that Rohit should maybe also take a break for the time being, and keep himself fit for the World Test Championship. He can come back again for the last few matches, but right now, he should take a little bit of a breather himself,\" Gavaskar said of Rohit, who is 28th (181 runs in seven games) among the batters of the season, not a position expected of the premier batsman of the country at the half-way stage of the IPL. \\n \\nMI, however, are standing behind the skipper. \"No, I don't think he (Rohit) should take rest. That's not my call to make. Obviously, we want Rohit playing, because he's a very good player, and a leader as well. If it's the best for Rohit, and he comes up to me and says that 'you know, I need a bit of a break,' then yes, we'll address that, and I'll consider that. He hasn't done that. So, yes, at the moment, if he's available to play, then he'll play,\" MI coach Boucher said. \\n \\nWith three wins from seven games, MI need all their might, Rohit and Jofra included, to fire to resuscitate their hopes in the season that seems slipping from their grasp. \\n \\nB2$ April 30, 2023 at 19:30 IST \\n \\nB3$ Wankhede Stadium, Mumbai \\n \\nB4$ The pitch and the ground have favoured batters and stroke-makers usually, with the bounce also bringing tall pacers into the equation. \\n \\nB5$ \\n \\n \\nB6$ \\n \\nTactics and match-ups: The distribution of overs amongst their bowlers, particularly Chawla could be a point to ponder. The legspinner has dismissed Sanju Samson twice in 36 balls, and is also likely to match-up well against Hetmyer, whose overall strike-rate (107) and average (18) against legspin is not so handy. The spinner thus could be in play through the middle to latter part of the innings if this match-up is to be exploited. \\n \\nWith Jofra Archer available for selection, MI are likely to leave out Riley Meredith. Arjun Tendulkar set to retain his position so is Nehal Wadhera. \\n \\nB7$ Rohit Sharma, Ishan Kishan, Suryakumar Yadav, Cameron Green, Tim David, Tilak Varma, Nehal Wadhera, Arjun Tendulkar, Piyush Chawla, Jason Behrendoff, Jofra Archer \\n \\nB8$ \\n \\nB9$ The battle upfront with RR's swing bowlers against Mumbai's openers is loaded in favour of the bowlers. Both Sandeep Sharma and Trent Boult have troubled the openers in the past, while Rohit's struggle could continue even against the duo of Chahal and Ashwin, with the latter having dismissed him thrice. \\n \\nOne obvious change would be Trent Boult coming in the place of Adam Zampa with the rest of the XI unlikely to be disturbed. \\n \\nB7$ Yashasvi Jaiswal, Jos Buttler, Devdutt Padikkal, Sanju Samson, Shimron Hetmyer, Jason Holder, Dhruv Jurel, R Ashwin, Yuzvendra Chahal, Sandeep Sharma, Trent Boult \\n \\nB11$ \\n \\n\"I think Rohit's in good form. I think he's been hitting the ball really well in the nets. It's just about the day. He's got some good runs for him. He's playing a nice and aggressive brand of cricket. T20 cricket can sometimes be a risk because you're forced to play quite aggressively, and he's fulfilled the role we've let him to fulfil this season so far. You've probably seen he's been quite aggressive in the way his approach has been, which can take consistency away from your game. But we feel that if Rohit plays like that, then he can be devastating to any opposition.\" - B12$ \\n \\n\"It is anyone's guess really. There have been a few great games so far and (we are) only at the halfway mark. Every team is pushing for those eight or nine wins to hopefully get to the top two but we are just taking it game-by-game really. It is a big game for us, it (Mumbai Indians) is a big side that we are coming up against and nothing can change for us. We will go out to do well, which has been putting runs on the board and bowl well as a unit - that is our game plan.\" \\n \\nB13$",
