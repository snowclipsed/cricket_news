DC will be sweating now. They look listless and clueless. They don't know which problem to fix. Warner, their skipper, has gotten two fifties and still looks out of place. The spin duo of Kuldeep and Axar also haven't been able to exert any kind of pressure. Nortje has been expensive and the list is endless. So, hop tabs and follow the El Clasico!",

My role in the team is very clear. Just got the feel I would take that kind of a catch. Last game when we played here, it was a swimming pool and we were not able to keep the ball dry. We will have to get used to wet balls. Yuzi and Ash bhai know how to do it with the wet ball. I think Ashwin is always looking at the batter.

It seemed as if they were batting on a different track as compared to the RR side. Lalit Yadav and Warner tried to infuse some energy into the chase but failed to bridge the gap much as the rate required continued to grow. Once Lalit was dismissed, the formalities were left to be addressed. Earlier, Jaiswal and Buttler once again went bonkers to set it up for RR.

You'd think they aren't out of the contest, especially with their fearsome batting line-up. It all started with Jaiswal launching into Khaleel, hitting him for 5 fours in the very first over. He was to race away to a 25-ball half-century and when he was finally dismissed, the Royals were already racing along. His dismissal and that of Samson meant that the Capitals found a way back and they did keep the scoring under check. At 130 for 3 after 15 overs, the Royals seemed to have wasted a great start, but Buttler and Hetmyer were in and they ensured that the final 5 overs did matter - 69 runs and the Royals have fallen just one shy of 200. Mukesh Kumar was the best bowler on view, cleverly mixing his lengths and his pace, but the others went for runs. Can DC chase down 200 and get their first points of #IPL2023?

    "commText": "B0$ by B1$ \\n \\nEntering the game on the back of losses, both Rajasthan Royals and Delhi Capitals will be hoping to regroup quickly to get their campaign back on track as they face off in the second and final game in Guwahati. There will be additional pressure on the Capitals who have lost both their matches so far while the Royals will be keen to bounce back after a narrow loss to Punjab Kings at the same venue. \\n \\nAn evening match at the Barsapara Cricket Stadium on Wednesday meant the teams had to contend with the dew factor right from the start but that won't be much of a worry for game No.11, although the batting-friendly nature of the wickets here will keep the bowlers on their toes. This might come as a bit of relief for the Capitals' batters who have struggled with the bat in both their matches so far -- against pace in particular. \\n \\nSourav Ganguly, the Capitals' team director, had suggested that Axar Patel could bat a bit higher while they are also likely to bring in Rovman Powell as Mitchell Marsh will be flying back home to get married and will therefore be unavailable for the next six-seven days, according to fast bowling coach James Hopes. \\n \\n \\nThe Royals had to re-jig their batting order against the Kings, due to a finger injury Buttler sustained while catching. Skipper Sanju Samson said the England batter did not have any problems later as he came out to bat but according to team director Kumar Sangakkara, they are awaiting a report from the medical staff to determine his participation in the next game. The position of Devdutt Padikkal, meanwhile, remains a concern for the team as he has struggled so far in the IPL and left the middle order with too much to do against Punjab - although Shimron Hetmyer and debutant Dhruv Jurel nearly pulled off an incredible run-chase. \\n \\nB2$ Saturday, April 8 at 15:30 IST \\n \\nB3$ Barsapara Cricket Stadium, Guwahati \\n \\nB4$ Warm conditions and another high-scoring encounter. \\n \\nB5$ The two teams have a perfect 50-50 record, with both having won 13 encounters facing off against each other. In the previous season, RR won their first game against Delhi, riding on Jos Buttler's century to post 222, which proved beyond the opposition's reach. DC hit back with an eight-wicket victory, chasing down a target of 161 with ease, thanks to Mitchell Marsh's 89 and David Warner's measured half-century. \\n \\nB6$ \\n \\nB7$ \\n \\nB8$ The hosts could look at using R Ashwin inside the powerplay considering he is a good match-up option against David Warner. The DC skipper has been dismissed by Ashwin a couple of times and has a strike rate of 107.53 against the offspinner. Furthermore, Ashwin has dismissed Prithvi Shaw twice while Trent Boult has also been successful against the right-handed DC opener, having picked up his wicket three times while conceding 28 runs off 25 balls. \\n \\nB9$ Yashasvi Jaiswal, Jos Buttler, Sanju Samson(c/wk), Devdutt Padikkal/Dhruv Jurel, Riyan Parag, Shimron Hetmyer, Jason Holder, Ravichandran Ashwin, Trent Boult, KM Asif, Yuzvendra Chahal. \\n \\nB10$ \\n \\nB11$ Warner was seen practising right-handed for a while a day before the match, possibly gearing up for switch-hits against Ashwin, having not fared too well against the RR spinner. Rovman Powell has scored 45 runs off 24 balls against Boult but he will also be wary that the left-arm pacer has dismissed him three times. DC could also look at keeping an over or two of Kuldeep against Shimron Hetmyer, with the West Indian having a strike-rate of 119.12 against bowlers spinning the ball away from him. Axar is a good option against Samson as the RR captain has been dismissed twice by him and also has a strike rate of 111.67. \\n \\nB9$ Prithvi Shaw, David Warner (c), Rilee Rossouw, Rovman Powell, Axar Patel, Sarfaraz Khan/Yash Dhull, Abishek Porel (wk), Aman Hakim Khan, Kuldeep Yadav, Anrich Nortje, Mukesh Kumar. \\n \\nB13$ \\n \\n- David Warner needs 31 more runs to reach the tally of 500 against Rajasthan Royals. Nine players have 500-plus runs against RR, with Shikhar Dhawan (662 runs) heading the list. \\n \\n- R Ashwin needs two more wickets to equal Harbhajan Singh, who tops the list of wicket-takers against Delhi Capitals with 24 scalps. \\n \\n- Yuzvendra Chahal has an excellent record against right-handed batters, having picked up 65 wickets in the IPL since 2019. He averages 17.57 against right-handed batters, with an economy of 7.15. Compared to this, he has dismissed left-handers only 24 times, although his economy rate of 7.84 against them is not a bad thing from RR's perspective. \\n \\nB14$ \\n \\n\"Each player's ability to face certain sections of the game is different. Hetmyer has a very specific role and he's very happy to do that role as he did for us last season. He is one of the best players going around in that position in all of T20 cricket in the world and we are very excited to see that he almost won us the game from a very difficult position for us along with Dhruv Jurel. There are times when people might walk in early if that situation is one that we plan for him. And we'll keep really believing in our strategy.\" B15$ all but rules out a promotion for Hetmyer. \\n \\n\"All the teams have been a little bit different on how they are doing it. Unfortunately we do not have the all-round depth to have seven-eight bowling options in our team. So we can either use the Impact Player to strengthen our batting but our bowling at the moment, if we bring in six genuine bowling options without Mitch Marsh here, it will weaken our batting significantly. Even in bowl-first, bat-first scenarios. So tomorrow you might see something a bit different from us.\" B16$ on DC using the Impact Player.",
