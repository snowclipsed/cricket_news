I am trying to set the tempo. Glad to get some scores in the powerplay. I understand one of us has to bat big. We have a long batting line-up. We want these guys to come out and bat freely. We watched Tilak last season. We all know what he can. I love his approach. He doesn't play the bowler, he plays the ball. We will see him play for a lot of teams. Life has come a full circle. Arjun has been a part of this team for three years. He understands what he wants to do. He is quite confident as well. He is clear in his plans.

I'm just wondering ... the ball feels as though it'll come on to the bat on this but because the grass is cut so low, I'm not sure. I don't know if it'll grip a little bit for the slowmen. But it looks beautiful. If later in the game, dew comes in, it'll slide on nicely. From a batting perspective, you come out here and you'll enjoy seeing this.\"",

    "commText": "B0$ \\n \\nSunrisers Hyderabad and Mumbai Indians have made a similar start to this year's IPL. Both teams began the campaign on a poor note, losing their first two games. But since then, they have also quickly turned the tables around by winning the next two to head into this clash with a lot of confidence. By the end of Tuesday (April 18) though, one of them will see their momentum get halted. \\n \\nMI in particular will be very pleased with the turn of events. Unlike the SRH squad, MI's didn't ooze confidence especially with Jofra Archer also getting sidelined recently. After two heavy defeats to begin with, they picked up a tight win over Delhi Capitals before squashing Kolkata Knight Riders with the bat. Venkatesh Iyer's century didn't cause any harm as Ishan Kishan blazed his way to a quickfire fifty to set up the win. More than anything, they saw Suryakumar Yadav get into some kind of form with a 25-ball 43 and that should bode well going ahead. \\n \\nPiyush Chawla has been in excellent form to bolster that spin attack and it will be interesting to see how he fares against the likes of Abhishek Sharma and Rahul Tripathi who prefer smashing spin over pace. Abhishek himself made a successful return to the XI despite being moved to the middle order. Harry Brook, brought in as a finisher, was sent up the order to open the innings after his jittery start and the move has paid dividends with the young English batter coming up with a sparkling century in the last game. Mayank Markande, a former MI player, has been impressive ever since he replaced Adil Rashid in the XI. \\n \\nB1$ SRH vs MI, April 18 at 19:30 IST \\n \\nB2$ Rajiv Gandhi International Stadium, Hyderabad \\n \\nB3$ Warm temperatures are expected to greet the sides. Spin has definitely played a part here but in terms of the batting, it's been a mixed bag. Rajasthan Royals scored heavily in the first game but Punjab Kings caved in quite easily. \\n \\nB4$ \\n \\nB5$ \\n \\nB6$ Ishan Kishan has had his issues against left-arm seamers since last year's IPL. SRH will likely have at least two in their XI to counter his threat. Abhishek Sharma in the middle could be the way to go for now given his record against spin. MI do have the likes of Piyush Chawla, Hrithik Shokeen and Kumar Kartikeya in their ranks. \\n \\nB7$ Harry Brook, Mayank Agarwal, Rahul Tripathi, Aiden Markram (c), Abhishek Sharma, Heinrich Klaasen (wk), Washington Sundar, Marco Jansen, Bhuvneshwar Kumar, Umran Malik, T Natarajan \\n \\nB8$ \\n \\nWill MI stick with Duan Jansen after his outing against KKR? If Jofra Archer is indeed fit, he will slot back in straightaway. \\n \\nB6$ Mayank Agarwal is in poor nick. Spin has usually been his strength but he has been dismissed by legspinners twice already this season. Tim David has a strike rate over 200 against pace in the IPL. He will be the key for MI at the death against the likes of T Natarajan, Umran Malik and Bhuvneshwar Kumar. \\n \\nB7$ Ishan Kishan (wk), Cameron Green, Tilak Varma, Suryakumar Yadav (c), Tim David, Nehal Wadhera, Arjun Tendulkar, Duan Jansen/Jofra Archer, Hrithik Shokeen, Piyush Chawla, Riley Meredith \\n \\nB11$ \\n \\n- Rohit Sharma averages over 38 in Hyderabad but his numbers against Washington Sundar are sub-par. The offspinner has dismissed him thrice in 26 deliveries, conceding only 25. \\n \\n- Harry Brook averages 36.45 at a strike rate of 148.30 against pace in T20 cricket since 2021. Those numbers drop down to 18.53 and 119.83 against leg spin.",
