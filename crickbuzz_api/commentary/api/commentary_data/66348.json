I'm trying to minimize the difference between leg spin and googly, holding them the same way. I keep working on it in the nets, want to make it perfect. Sometimes I lose my lines, with my bowling if I can keep the consistency with line and length then I know the batters will have problems. I just keep it simple, try to understand what I do wrong in games. It is more to do with my line and length, I bowled a few bad balls and was punished. So I just look back and talk to the video analysts, and work on my pitch maps. (On mentoring Noor Ahmed) It makes it easier, we speak Pashto in the middle. Noor is happy that I'm with him and he's always someone who listens and puts it the hard work. (On how many wrist spinners exist in Afghanistan) To be honest, more than 1000 now. I have been to a few academies and there are so many leg spinners. There were 250 of them after my first year of IPL. Now, I've been playing IPL for 6-7 years now, and there are so many in Afghanistan trying to copy me. I receive so many videos everyday of new leg spinners. I'm so happy to see Noor perform here, there are so many more like Qais Ahmed, Zahir Khan who haven't got their opportunities in IPL but when they do they can perform really well.",

What a thumping reply, sign of a champion team. The day started with Pandya getting the better of Buttler, and then Jaiswal was run out by skipper Samson. Josh Little then picked up Samson, before the Afghan duo of Rashid Khan and Noor Ahmad ran through that middle-order. It looked like the hosts might even struggle to get past 100 at one stage, but then Trent Boult played a few shots to get RR to 118. That target though was no match, as GT replied confidently with both Saha and Gill getting amongst the runs. Gill was deceived by a leg spinner from Chahal, but that wicket probably made things worse for them. As Gill was replaced by Hardik, and he totally latched onto Zampa. He smoked him for three sixes and a four, and was in a hurry to finish things. A resounding win for GT, who have Saha and Rashid get back to form, and Hardik Pandya is scoring runs quickly once again. Rajasthan will brush it aside as an off day, but the problem is these off days have been coming far too regularly now for Sanju Samson and co.

Sometimes I lose my lines, with my bowling if I can keep the consistency with line and length then I know the batters will have problems. I just keep it simple, try to understand what I do wrong in games. It is more to do with my line and length, I bowled a few bad balls and was punished. So I just look back and talk to the video analysts, and work on my pitch maps. (On mentoring Noor Ahmed) It makes it easier, we speak Pashto in the middle. Noor is happy that I'm with him and he's always someone who listens and puts it the hard work. (On how many wrist spinners exist in Afghanistan) To be honest, more than 1000 now. I have been to a few academies and there are so many leg spinners. There were 250 of them after my first year of IPL. Now, I've been playing IPL for 6-7 years now, and there are so many in Afghanistan trying to copy me. I receive so many videos everyday of new leg spinners. I'm so happy to see Noor perform here, there are so many more like Qais Ahmed, Zahir Khan who haven't got their opportunities in IPL but when they do they can perform really well.",

What a thumping reply, sign of a champion team. The day started with Pandya getting the better of Buttler, and then Jaiswal was run out by skipper Samson. Josh Little then picked up Samson, before the Afghan duo of Rashid Khan and Noor Ahmad ran through that middle-order. It looked like the hosts might even struggle to get past 100 at one stage, but then Trent Boult played a few shots to get RR to 118. That target though was no match, as GT replied confidently with both Saha and Gill getting amongst the runs. Gill was deceived by a leg spinner from Chahal, but that wicket probably made things worse for them. As Gill was replaced by Hardik, and he totally latched onto Zampa. He smoked him for three sixes and a four, and was in a hurry to finish things. A resounding win for GT, who have Saha and Rashid get back to form, and Hardik Pandya is scoring runs quickly once again. Rajasthan will brush it aside as an off day, but the problem is these off days have been coming far too regularly now for Sanju Samson and co.

This was a simple length delivery just around off stump. Sanju moved across the stumps to flick to mid-wicket. Wonder why he did that because the left-armer's angle across RHB is anyway going to make it tougher. This ball did seem to seam away a wee bit. Massive leading edge. Hardik waits ages under the ball at cover and takes a very good catch. Sanju stares at the pitch. Still staring and looking back as he drags himself off unwillingly. Big, big wicket. Sanju was looking so good and the over where Little was losing the battle, he gets the main man. B1$",

Sanju was out of the crease, but saw the fielding and went back. Jaiswal was already at his end by then and the fielder had ample time to relay a calm throw to Rashid's end.

    "commText": "B0$    \\n   \\n\"We've found ways to win,\" quipped David Miller in the press conference on Thursday (May 4) while talking about managing the expectations that come with being the defending champions. Those five words perhaps sum up their title run of last season when nobody gave them a chance of starting life in the IPL with glory. This year too stars have aligned for them as they sit atop the points table despite arriving in Jaipur on the back of a botched up chase. A win will give them a three-point lead at the top - gold dust in a season like this that will keep them away from having to partake in a five or even six-way fight for the playoffs.   \\n   \\nRajasthan Royals, who have already beaten GT once this season, have the chance to usurp them to the top spot, adding to the narrative of arguably the most competitive season of IPL. To put it in context, RR's win will take them to the top but only two points will separate them and PBKS at sixth.   \\n   \\nWhat also adds spice to Friday's fixture is the fact that these are two smartly-built squads that didn't just fight it out for the title last season but also began seamlessly this year - four wins in first five for RR; three in five for GT. Along the way, imperfections in both their squads have been exposed, that they can each exploit in Jaipur. RR have shown a tendency to slow down in the middle-overs, where GT can get aggressive from both ends with the spin of Rashid Khan and Noor Ahmed. GT's issues are more on an individual level, Saha's effectiveness in the PowerPlay dipping and Hardik Pandya's batting stocks being at an all-time low.   \\n   \\nBoth teams, however, with six (GT) and five (RR) wins, and excellent NRRs have enough going for them to nullify the issues that have crept up over the course of a tough season that also involves continuous travel across the country for the first time since 2019. Friday's game could be a great starting point for both to achieve that.   \\n   \\nB1$ Rajasthan Royals vs Gujarat Titans, May 5 2023, 7.30 PM IST   \\n   \\nB2$ Sawai Mansingh stadium, Jaipur   \\n   \\nB3$ Two matches have happened at this venue so far, with polar opposite conditions. When the surface was slow and sluggish, RR struggled, Buttler scored at less than a 100 strike rate and LSG defended 154/7 against the hosts. When the ball flew off the deck and off the bat, Yashasvi Jaiswal smashed 77 off 43 and RR made 202/5 in a 32-run win over CSK. Both teams have had recent trouble on slow pitches and will hope the one they play on has plenty of runs on it.   \\n   \\nB4$ GT beat RR in all the three games they faced them last season - including the final - but RR have already pulled one back this year with a victory in Ahmedabad.   \\n   \\nB5$   \\n   \\nB6$   \\n   \\nB7$ No new niggles reported   \\n   \\nB8$ Trent Boult has had the wood over GT's struggling opener Wriddhiman Saha, dismissing him thrice in 24 balls and giving away just 22 runs.   \\n   \\nB9$ Jos Buttler, Yashasvi Jaiswal, Devdutt Padikkal, Sanju Samson, Shimron Hetmyer, Dhruv Jurel, Jason Holder, R Ashwin, Yuzvendra Chahal, Trent Boult, Sandeep Sharma   \\n   \\nIn their last home game, RR used left-arm pacer Kuldip Yadav as the impact sub in the absence of Trent Boult, who was out with a niggle. In the game that Boult returned (against MI in Wankhede), Kuldeep Sen - the right-arm quick - was the sub but bowled just one over for 20 runs. It could be one of these two quicks swapping in, in this fixture.   \\n   \\nThrough the middle-overs, Chahal will be key against GT skipper Hardik Pandya, who has been batting at one-drop lately. While Hardik has favourable numbers against the impressive R Ashwin (64 off 43 balls, 0 dismissals), he has found it tough to put away the leg-spinner (48 runs off 57 balls, 3 dismissals). Ashwin however, can tie down the left-handed David Miller, who only scores at a measly 112.33 against him.   \\n   \\nB10$   \\n   \\nB7$ This could be Joshua Little's last game this season before joining the national squad for the ODI series against Bangladesh in England that begins from May 9.   \\n   \\nB8$ Denying RR the chance to lay the PowerPlay platform through Buttler should be GT's top-priority, and for that they have the leading wicket-taker this season Mohammed Shami. The fast bowler also has the most wickets in the PowerPlay this season (12), four more than the next best Mohammed Siraj.   \\n   \\nBy his lofty standards, Buttler has had a quiet season, which GT will hope to extend on Friday. Buttler has scored 79 off 62 balls against Shami at a strike rate of 127.42, which are modest numbers by his lofty standards. Shami has also dismissed him twice - including in the reverse fixture last month for a five-ball duck.   \\n   \\nShami is also the man for GT to deal with RR's finisher Shimron Hetmyer. The West Indian has been dismissed four times in the 24 balls he's faced against him and has scored just 17 runs. For Sanju Samson, GT's go-to bowler has to be Rashid Khan who has conceded runs at just 117.20. To put that in perspective, the RR captain scores at a strike rate of 186.21 and 156.67 against Shami and Hardik Pandya.   \\n   \\nB9$ Wriddihman Saha, Shubman Gill, Vijay Shankar, Hardik Pandya, David Miller, Abhinav Manohar, Rahul Tewatia, Rashid Khan, Noor Ahmed, Joshua Little, Mohammed Shami   \\n   \\nBased on what happens at the toss, either of Shubman Gill or Mohit Sharma will be the impact substitute [Gill if they bowl first, Mohit if they bat first].   \\n   \\nB14$   \\n   \\n\"I think Dhruv has had a fantastic season. He was with us last year as well and the talent is clear to see. His performances have been fantastic. I think his mindset is brilliant. He plays without fear, he plays for the team and in a tough role - No. 5, 6, 7 can be a tricky role in T20 cricket, but he's playing that brilliantly well. He's been excellent for us this year.\" - B15$ on B16$   \\n   \\n\"I never really felt that I've been poor against spin but it's definitely an area I needed to work on. As the years have gone on, I've focussed more on it. The biggest thing for me is mindset, rather than technical changes. I feel like I am playing spin a lot better, mentally I am feeling a lot better. It's just about going out there and trusting that preparation.\" - B17$ on his improving game against spin.   \\n   \\nB18$   \\n   \\n- Shami, the leading wicket-taker this season, has picked 18 wickets in 13 outings against RR   \\n   \\n- Saha has struggled against left-arm pacers this season - scoring 42 off 30 balls faced and getting out thrice.   \\n   \\n- Jaipur has been the spinners' ally in the two matches so far - they have picked 9 wickets in 33 overs at a strike rate of 22 and economy rate of 7.72. Pacers meanwhile have 11 wickets in 47 overs at a strike rate of 25.63 and economy rate of 8.47",
