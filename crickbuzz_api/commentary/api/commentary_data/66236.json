SRH won comfortably against PBKS. Although, we will remember this game more because of Dhawan\u2019s superlative knock. Join us tomorrow for what will be another high-voltage contest as RCB are back home and they will host LSG. This is B0$ signing off on behalf of B1$ and B2$. Till then, goodbye and cheers!",

Dhawan saw one after the other leave as SRH's seamers and Mayank Markande's leggies and googlies proved to be lethal.  From 63/3 PBKS slipped to 78/8 and then 88/9 at the end of 15 overs. But Dhawan then took charge as 55 came off the last 5 overs in which he farmed the strike. Only good bowling from Natarajan in the last over denied what was a fantastic and thoroughly well-deserved 100 for Dhawan. Some of the shots that PBKS played in that collapse was shocking to say the least. Dhawan's innings has given PBKS a tiny lease of life though. Can they make use of it?

    "commText": "B0$ \\n \\nSunrisers Hyderabad and Punjab Kings have put pre-tournament predictions in the bin at least in the first week of the tournament. While SRH were expected to hit the ground running after a phenomenal auction, PBKS were touted to have another topsy-turvy campaign. However, SRH have capitulated in both the games they have played so far whereas PBKS, on the other hand, have made it two wins out of two games. \\n \\nApart from Jonny Bairstow, PBKS haven't had Liam Livingstone and Kagiso Rabada in their opening two games, weakening their XI further. Their Indian batting contingent didn't look intimidating as well on paper but Prabhsimran Singh and Jitesh Sharma have come up with eye-catching cameos whereas skipper Shikhar Dhawan and Bhanuka Rajapaksa have delivered as well. Arshdeep Singh has been amongst the wickets and Nathan Ellis might well keep Rabada out of the XI after wrecking the Rajasthan Royals middle order in the last game. \\n \\nSRH, on the other hand, may have brushed aside the loss in their opening game given they weren't at full strength but even the return of Aiden Markram didn't help their cause against Lucknow Super Giants. Their decision to not bring in Heinrich Klaasen despite the batting collapse was indeed quite surprising and their big money signing Harry Brook has looked rattled so far. SRH need the batting to click in order to get their campaign rolling in order to avoid a third loss in a row. \\n \\nB1$Sunrisers Hyderabad vs Punjab Kings, IPL 2023, April 9, 19:30 IST \\n \\nB2$Rajiv Gandhi International Stadium, Hyderabad \\n \\nB3$A high-scoring game could be on the cards going by what we witnessed in the first game at this venue this season. But at the same time, spin did play a major role in the second half. \\n \\nB4$ \\n \\nB5$ \\n \\nB6$ \\n \\nIf Rabada does feature, Mayank Agarwal can back himself to make his first impactful contribution for his new franchise. Not many batters have a great record against the South African pacer in the IPL but Agarwal has a strike rate of 150 against Rabada having faced 38 balls. \\n \\nB7$Abhishek Sharma, Mayank Agarwal, Rahul Tripathi, Aiden Markram (C), Harry Brook, Heinrich Klaasen (WK), Washington Sundar, Adil Rashid/Marco Jansen, Bhuvneshwar Kumar, T Natarajan, Umran Malik \\n \\nB8$ \\n \\nB6$ \\n \\nA lot has been made of SRH's batting lineup being dominated by right-handers and that could haunt them in this clash as well given Rahul Chahar's record. In 53 innings, he has picked 40 wickets at an economy rate of 7.34. Apart from that, one of SRH's left-handers Abhishek Sharma has already been dismissed by Chahar twice in just 11 deliveries. \\n \\nB7$Shikhar Dhawan (C), Prabhsimran Singh, Bhanuka Rajapaksa, Jitesh Sharma (WK), Sikandar Raza, Shahrukh Khan, Sam Curran, Harpreet Brar, Rahul Chahar, Nathan Ellis, Arshdeep Singh \\n \\nB11$ \\n \\nBhuvneshwar Kumar enjoys a tremendous record against the franchise from Punjab, picking up 26 wickets in 18 games. \\n \\nSam Curran's strike rate against left-arm pacers in the IPL is 256.25 and SRH might likely have a couple of them in their XI.",
