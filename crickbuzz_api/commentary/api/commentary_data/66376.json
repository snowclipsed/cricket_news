We knew in a quick outfield like this we'll score more than expected, but we had to be aggressive. Abhishek started up off, and then Tripathi gave him company. Then those cameos from Phillips and Klaasy. (On Samad's finishing skills) I think you got to train it, and put yourself under pressure. You are playing high risk cricket, so that's where technique comes in.",

He did it again today but that no-ball ruined our result. We played really well with the bat to put up that kind of a score on this wicket, but I think they (SRH) batted really sensibly, credit has to go to them for the way they batted. (About how he felt after the last ball was called a no-ball) Nothing much, it's a no ball, just have to bowl it again as simple as that, you don't think about it too much. Sandeep knows what to do.

The last few weeks for me have been really good to just be around T20 cricket. Been a long time since I\u2019ve had a block of time to concentrate only on T20. To get the opportunity to be here, learn from the coaches and see some young guys come through has been beneficial for me as a player. I\u2019m in this format just to try and look at the game slightly differently, and that\u2019s always what you want to do when you\u2019re new somewhere - just be a sponge and soak as much as possible. I may not be playing but I feel like I have had  a huge amount of learning in the last few weeks. If I get an opportunity, I\u2019ll try to do my best for the side.

    "commText": "B0$ by B1$ \\n \\nThe buzzword at the post-match press conference after Friday's humiliation for Rajasthan Royals was intent. Kumar Sangakkara admitted that being thoroughly outclassed by Gujarat Titans was embarrassing and rued the absence of batting intent and their inability to consolidate on a solid start. \\n \\nThat's been a recurring theme for this side as they've lost the most number of wickets between overs 7 and 15 (32) for all the teams this season, and have scored at a run rate of 7.82 in that period. Jos Buttler's dwindling form in the second half of the season have made the batting trouble through the middle even worse, and led to results like the one on Friday. \\n \\nSangakkara preferred to write off the bad result against the holders and expects the side to get back on course. The extent to which RR's season has gone pear-shaped can be gauged from this damning fact - they've won as many games in the last five outings (one) as their opponents for Sunday, who are languishing at the ninth spot. Sunday presents them the best opportunity and opposition to repair the recent damage and remain relevant in the race for the playoffs. \\n \\nFor SRH this season, expectation and reality have not even shared the same post code. At the auction this year, SRH made a squad with a bunch of exceptional T20 individuals, but more than a month into the season, they remain just that - a collection of individuals, failing to progress as a cohesive unit. \\n \\nHarry Brook's batting issues magnified SRH's struggles this year. The Englishman arrived with a massive ball-striking reputation and as a big-money signing (INR 13.25 Cr) but has struggled largely to adapt - 100* in one innings and a collective 63 in 8 others. Aiden Markram however, appeared to suggest on Saturday that he will be persisted with. Even in a season where just four points separates the team at the top (Gujarat Titans) and the team at seventh (Punjab Kings), SRH are still a few paces behind in the multi-team sprint to a top-four finish. \\n \\nB2$Rajasthan Royals vs Sunrisers Hyderabad, May 7 2023, 7.30 PM IST \\n \\nB3$Sawai Mansingh stadium, Jaipur \\n \\nB4$Another slow burner? The same surface that had the RR batters struggle for runs against GT will be used on Sunday. \\n \\nB5$In 17 encounters, RR have won 9 and SRH 8. At the venue, RR have won 2 of the three games played. \\n \\nB6$ \\n \\nB7$ \\n \\nB8$No absentees reported after the Friday game \\n \\nB9$Trent Boult has constantly made dents early in the PowerPlay but even Sandeep Sharma will be vital against SRH as he matches-up well against their opener Mayank Agarwal (47 runs in 44 balls; 3 dismissals). Mayank also has a feisty match-up against Chahal, having hit 72 off the 49 balls he's faced from the leggie. However, Chahal has got him out six times. \\n \\nB10$Jos Buttler, Yashasvi Jaiswal, Devdutt Padikkal, Sanju Samson, Shimron Hetmyer, Dhruv Jurel, Adam Zampa, R Ashwin, Yuzvendra Chahal, Trent Boult, Sandeep Sharma \\n \\nRR desperately turned to Riyan Parag in the previous fixture as the impact substitute as their batting innings fell apart after Sanju Samson decided to set a target. They will have to rethink the strategy even if they end up in a similar situation again as Parag has struggled all season to get runs under his belt. \\n \\nB11$ \\n \\nB8$None reported \\n \\nB9$SRH will hope Bhuvneshwar Kumar's vast experience will be handy in extending Jos Buttler's struggle. Bhuvneshwar has conceded 45 runs at a run-a-ball to the England batter in the IPL without getting him out. In all T20s, he has given away 88 off 82 and dismissed him five times. \\n \\nB10$Abhishek Sharma, Mayank Agarwal, Rahul Tripathi, Aiden Markram, Harry Brook, Heinrich Klaasen, Abdul Samad, Marco Jansen/Akeal Hossein, Bhuvneshwar Kumar, Mayank Markande, Kartik Tyagi \\n \\nEither Rahul Tripathi or T Natarajan is likely to be the impact substitute based on what happens at the toss. \\n \\nB15$ \\n \\n\"Games like these, most sides have pretty bad games. Unfortunately we've had one now late in the tournament. We're still a high quality side playing some very good cricket if you take this one out of the equation. We've got to accept the fact that we were extremely poor [against GT]. That's the first step, you realise it, you accept it and then try to come up with solutions for what the problems are. We know what the issues were. Just training mindlessly is not the way. It's just the case of making sure the guys are committed to coming back harder, smarter in the next game and committing to the quality of cricket that we play.\" - B16$ on RR's flattening defeat to GT on Friday. \\n \\n\"For us, I think the equation now is quite simple. We haven't done the math yet but we're assuming it is a must-win game every time we take the field so the guys are looking forward to that. It's not the most ideal position for the team to be in but unfortunately we can't undo the past. We've got five games to look forward to.\" - SRH captain B17$ \\n \\nB18$ \\n \\n- Yuzvendra Chahal has picked 24 wickets in 18 outings against SRH, with a best of 4 for 17 \\n \\n- Heinrich Klaasen has been SRH's best batter against spin - 93 runs off 53 balls at a strike rate of 175.47 and one dismissal.",
