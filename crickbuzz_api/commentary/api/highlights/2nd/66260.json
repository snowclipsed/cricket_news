A maiden IPL wicket for Vyshak and this is a moment to cherish. Huge huge wicket for the Royal Challengers and they're jumping for joy. Warner looks stunned, has a look at his bat and walks away - short of a good length and angling across the left-hander, don't think it came on as well as Warner expected, was through with the shot early and toe-ended the lob towards mid-wicket, Kohli ran in and completed an easy catch, RCB right on top now.
